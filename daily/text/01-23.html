<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span id=3D"en-MSG-447" class=3D"text Gen-32-1-Gen-32-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">32&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-2&nbsp;</sup>And Jacob went his way. Angels of God met him. When Jacob saw them he said, &ldquo;Oh! God&rsquo;s Camp!&rdquo; And he named the place Mahanaim (Campground).</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-448" class=3D"text Gen-32-3-Gen-32-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">3-5&nbsp;</sup>Then Jacob sent messengers on ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir in Edom. He instructed them: &ldquo;Tell my master Esau this, &lsquo;A message from your servant Jacob: I&rsquo;ve been staying with Laban and couldn&rsquo;t get away until now. I&rsquo;ve acquired cattle and donkeys and sheep; also men and women servants. I&rsquo;m telling you all this, my master, hoping for your approval.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-449" class=3D"text Gen-32-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>The messengers came back to Jacob and said, &ldquo;We talked to your brother Esau and he&rsquo;s on his way to meet you. But he has four hundred men with him.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-450" class=3D"text Gen-32-7-Gen-32-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7-8&nbsp;</sup>Jacob was scared. Very scared. Panicked, he divided his people, sheep, cattle, and camels into two camps. He thought, &ldquo;If Esau comes on the first camp and attacks it, the other camp has a chance to get away.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-451" class=3D"text Gen-32-9-Gen-32-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9-12&nbsp;</sup>And then Jacob prayed, &ldquo;God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, <span class=3D"small-caps divine-name" style=3D"font-variant: small-caps;">God</span> who told me, &lsquo;Go back to your parents&rsquo; homeland and I&rsquo;ll treat you well.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t deserve all the love and loyalty you&rsquo;ve shown me. When I left here and crossed the Jordan I only had the clothes on my back, and now look at me&mdash;two camps! Save me, please, from the violence of my brother, my angry brother! I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll come and attack us all, me, the mothers and the children. You yourself said, &lsquo;I will treat you well; I&rsquo;ll make your descendants like the sands of the sea, far too many to count.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-452" class=3D"text Gen-32-13-Gen-32-16" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">13-16&nbsp;</sup>He slept the night there. Then he prepared a present for his brother Esau from his possessions: two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, thirty camels with their nursing young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. He put a servant in charge of each herd and said, &ldquo;Go ahead of me and keep a healthy space between each herd.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-453" class=3D"text Gen-32-17-Gen-32-18" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">17-18&nbsp;</sup>Then he instructed the first one out: &ldquo;When my brother Esau comes close and asks, &lsquo;Who is your master? Where are you going? Who owns these?&rsquo;&mdash;answer him like this, &lsquo;Your servant Jacob. They are a gift to my master Esau. He&rsquo;s on his way.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-454" class=3D"text Gen-32-19-Gen-32-20" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">19-20&nbsp;</sup>He gave the same instructions to the second servant and to the third&mdash;to each in turn as they set out with their herds: &ldquo;Say &lsquo;Your servant Jacob is on his way behind us.&rsquo;&rdquo; He thought, &ldquo;I will soften him up with the succession of gifts. Then when he sees me face-to-face, maybe he&rsquo;ll be glad to welcome me.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-455" class=3D"text Gen-32-21" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>So his gifts went before him while he settled down for the night in the camp.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-456" class=3D"text Gen-32-22-Gen-32-23" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">22-23&nbsp;</sup>But during the night he got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven children and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. He got them safely across the brook along with all his possessions.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-457" class=3D"text Gen-32-24-Gen-32-25" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">24-25&nbsp;</sup>But Jacob stayed behind by himself, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak. When the man saw that he couldn&rsquo;t get the best of Jacob as they wrestled, he deliberately threw Jacob&rsquo;s hip out of joint.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-458" class=3D"text Gen-32-26" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>The man said, &ldquo;Let me go; it&rsquo;s daybreak.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Gen-32-26" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jacob said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not letting you go &rsquo;til you bless me.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-459" class=3D"text Gen-32-27" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>The man said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Gen-32-27" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">He answered, &ldquo;Jacob.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-460" class=3D"text Gen-32-28" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>The man said, &ldquo;But no longer. Your name is no longer Jacob. From now on it&rsquo;s Israel (God-Wrestler); you&rsquo;ve wrestled with God and you&rsquo;ve come through.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-461" class=3D"text Gen-32-29" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Jacob asked, &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Gen-32-29" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The man said, &ldquo;Why do you want to know my name?&rdquo; And then, right then and there, he blessed him.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-462" class=3D"text Gen-32-30" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Jacob named the place Peniel (God&rsquo;s Face) because, he said, &ldquo;I saw God face-to-face and lived to tell the story!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-463" class=3D"text Gen-32-31-Gen-32-32" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">31-32&nbsp;</sup>The sun came up as he left Peniel, limping because of his hip. (This is why Israelites to this day don&rsquo;t eat the hip muscle; because Jacob&rsquo;s hip was thrown out of joint.)</span></div>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span id=3D"en-MSG-464" class=3D"text Gen-33-1-Gen-33-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">33&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-4&nbsp;</sup>Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming with his four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah and Rachel and the two maidservants. He put the maidservants out in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last. He led the way and, as he approached his brother, bowed seven times, honoring his brother. But Esau ran up and embraced him, held him tight and kissed him. And they both wept.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-465" class=3D"text Gen-33-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Then Esau looked around and saw the women and children: &ldquo;And who are these with you?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Gen-33-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jacob said, &ldquo;The children that God saw fit to bless me with.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-466" class=3D"text Gen-33-6-Gen-33-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">6-7&nbsp;</sup>Then the maidservants came up with their children and bowed; then Leah and her children, also bowing; and finally, Joseph and Rachel came up and bowed to Esau.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-467" class=3D"text Gen-33-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Esau then asked, &ldquo;And what was the meaning of all those herds that I met?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Gen-33-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">&ldquo;I was hoping that they would pave the way for my master to welcome me.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-468" class=3D"text Gen-33-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Esau said, &ldquo;Oh, brother. I have plenty of everything&mdash;keep what is yours for yourself.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-469" class=3D"text Gen-33-10-Gen-33-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">10-11&nbsp;</sup>Jacob said, &ldquo;Please. If you can find it in your heart to welcome me, accept these gifts. When I saw your face, it was as the face of God smiling on me. Accept the gifts I have brought for you. God has been good to me and I have more than enough.&rdquo; Jacob urged the gifts on him and Esau accepted.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-470" class=3D"text Gen-33-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Then Esau said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start out on our way; I&rsquo;ll take the lead.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-471" class=3D"text Gen-33-13-Gen-33-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">13-14&nbsp;</sup>But Jacob said, &ldquo;My master can see that the children are frail. And the flocks and herds are nursing, making for slow going. If I push them too hard, even for a day, I&rsquo;d lose them all. So, master, you go on ahead of your servant, while I take it easy at the pace of my flocks and children. I&rsquo;ll catch up with you in Seir.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-472" class=3D"text Gen-33-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Esau said, &ldquo;Let me at least lend you some of my men.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Gen-33-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need,&rdquo; said Jacob. &ldquo;Your generous welcome is all I need or want.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-473" class=3D"text Gen-33-16" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>So Esau set out that day and made his way back to Seir.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-474" class=3D"text Gen-33-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>And Jacob left for Succoth. He built a shelter for himself and sheds for his livestock. That&rsquo;s how the place came to be called Succoth (Sheds).</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-475" class=3D"text Gen-33-18-Gen-33-20" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">18-20&nbsp;</sup>And that&rsquo;s how it happened that Jacob arrived all in one piece in Shechem in the land of Canaan&mdash;all the way from Paddan Aram. He camped near the city. He bought the land where he pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. He paid a hundred silver coins for it. Then he built an altar there and named it El-Elohe-Israel (Mighty Is the God of Israel).</span></div>
<div class=3D"center"><span class=3D"text Gen-33-18-Gen-33-20" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">* * *</span></div>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span id=3D"en-MSG-476" class=3D"text Gen-34-1-Gen-34-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">34&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-4&nbsp;</sup>One day Dinah, the daughter Leah had given Jacob, went to visit some of the women in that country. Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite who was chieftain there, saw her and raped her. Then he felt a strong attraction to Dinah, Jacob&rsquo;s daughter, fell in love with her, and wooed her. Shechem went to his father Hamor, &ldquo;Get me this girl for my wife.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-477" class=3D"text Gen-34-5-Gen-34-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5-7&nbsp;</sup>Jacob heard that Shechem had raped his daughter Dinah, but his sons were out in the fields with the livestock so he didn&rsquo;t say anything until they got home. Hamor, Shechem&rsquo;s father, went to Jacob to work out marriage arrangements. Meanwhile Jacob&rsquo;s sons on their way back from the fields heard what had happened. They were outraged, explosive with anger. Shechem&rsquo;s rape of Jacob&rsquo;s daughter was intolerable in Israel and not to be put up with.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-478" class=3D"text Gen-34-8-Gen-34-10" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">8-10&nbsp;</sup>Hamor spoke with Jacob and his sons, &ldquo;My son Shechem is head over heels in love with your daughter&mdash;give her to him as his wife. Intermarry with us. Give your daughters to us and we&rsquo;ll give our daughters to you. Live together with us as one family. Settle down among us and make yourselves at home. Prosper among us.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-479" class=3D"text Gen-34-11-Gen-34-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">11-12&nbsp;</sup>Shechem then spoke for himself, addressing Dinah&rsquo;s father and brothers: &ldquo;Please, say yes. I&rsquo;ll pay anything. Set the bridal price as high as you will&mdash;the sky&rsquo;s the limit! Only give me this girl for my wife.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-480" class=3D"text Gen-34-13-Gen-34-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">13-17&nbsp;</sup>Jacob&rsquo;s sons answered Shechem and his father with cunning. Their sister, after all, had been raped. They said, &ldquo;This is impossible. We could never give our sister to a man who was uncircumcised. Why, we&rsquo;d be disgraced. The only condition on which we can talk business is if all your men become circumcised like us. Then we will freely exchange daughters in marriage and make ourselves at home among you and become one big, happy family. But if this is not an acceptable condition, we will take our sister and leave.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-481" class=3D"text Gen-34-18" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>That seemed fair enough to Hamor and his son Shechem.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-482" class=3D"text Gen-34-19" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>The young man was so smitten with Jacob&rsquo;s daughter that he proceeded to do what had been asked. He was also the most admired son in his father&rsquo;s family.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-483" class=3D"text Gen-34-20-Gen-34-23" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">20-23&nbsp;</sup>So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the public square and spoke to the town council: &ldquo;These men like us; they are our friends. Let them settle down here and make themselves at home; there&rsquo;s plenty of room in the country for them. And, just think, we can even exchange our daughters in marriage. But these men will only accept our invitation to live with us and become one big family on one condition, that all our males become circumcised just as they themselves are. This is a very good deal for us&mdash;these people are very wealthy with great herds of livestock and we&rsquo;re going to get our hands on it. So let&rsquo;s do what they ask and have them settle down with us.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-484" class=3D"text Gen-34-24" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Everyone who was anyone in the city agreed with Hamor and his son, Shechem; every male was circumcised.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-485" class=3D"text Gen-34-25-Gen-34-29" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">25-29&nbsp;</sup>Three days after the circumcision, while all the men were still very sore, two of Jacob&rsquo;s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah&rsquo;s brothers, each with his sword in hand, walked into the city as if they owned the place and murdered every man there. They also killed Hamor and his son Shechem, rescued Dinah from Shechem&rsquo;s house, and left. When the rest of Jacob&rsquo;s sons came on the scene of slaughter, they looted the entire city in retaliation for Dinah&rsquo;s rape. Flocks, herds, donkeys, belongings&mdash;everything, whether in the city or the fields&mdash;they took. And then they took all the wives and children captive and ransacked their homes for anything valuable.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-486" class=3D"text Gen-34-30" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made my name repulsive to the people here, these Canaanites and Perizzites. If they decided to gang up on us and attack, as few as we are we wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance; they&rsquo;d wipe me and my people right off the map.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-487" class=3D"text Gen-34-31" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>They said, &ldquo;Nobody is going to treat our sister like a whore and get by with it.&rdquo;</span></div>
