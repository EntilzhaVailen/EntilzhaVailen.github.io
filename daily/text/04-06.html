When Joab saw that he had two fronts to fight, before and behind, he took his pick of the best of Israel and deployed them to confront the Arameans. The rest of the army he put under the command of Abishai, his brother, and deployed them to confront the Ammonites. Then he said, &ldquo;If the Arameans are too much for me, you help me.

<div><span class=3D"text 2Sam-10-15-2Sam-10-19" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">17-19&nbsp;</sup>So David mustered Israel, crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Arameans went into battle formation, ready for David, and the fight was on. But the Arameans again scattered before Israel. David killed seven hundred chariot drivers and forty thousand cavalry. And he mortally wounded Shobach, the army commander, who died on the battlefield. When all the kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace and became Israel&rsquo;s vassals. The Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites ever again.</span></div>

I freed you from the fist of Saul. I gave you your master&rsquo;s daughter and other wives to have and to hold. I gave you both Israel and Judah. And if that hadn&rsquo;t been enough, I&rsquo;d have gladly thrown in much more. So why have you treated the word of&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;with brazen contempt, doing this great evil? You murdered Uriah the Hittite, then took his wife as your wife. Worse, you killed him with an Ammonite sword! And now, because you treated God with such contempt and took Uriah the Hittite&rsquo;s wife as your wife, killing and murder will continually plague your family. This is&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;speaking, remember! I&rsquo;ll make trouble for you out of your own family. I&rsquo;ll take your wives from right out in front of you. I&rsquo;ll give them to some neighbor, and he&rsquo;ll go to bed with them openly. You did your deed in secret; I&rsquo;m doing mine with the whole country watching!&rdquo;</span></div>

David prayed desperately to God for the little boy. He fasted, wouldn&rsquo;t go out, and slept on the floor. The elders in his family came in and tried to get him off the floor, but he wouldn&rsquo;t budge. Nor could they get him to eat anything. On the seventh day the child died. David&rsquo;s servants were afraid to tell him. They said, &ldquo;What do we do now? While the child was living he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to a word we said.

Hurry and get the rest of the troops together and set up camp here at the city and complete the capture yourself. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll capture it and get all the credit instead of you.&rdquo; So David marshaled all the troops, went to Rabbah, and fought and captured it. He took the crown from their king&rsquo;s head&mdash;very heavy with gold, and with a precious stone in it. It ended up on David&rsquo;s head. And they plundered the city, carrying off a great quantity of loot.</span></div>
