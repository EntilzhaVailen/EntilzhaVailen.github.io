<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28825a"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 7:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Jesus reproaches the teachers, who insist upon &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; that they themselves have sometimes invented, with a legalism that allows them to have a good conscience, even as they disregard the essential demands of the Law (Ex 20:12;&nbsp;21:17;&nbsp;Lev 20:9;&nbsp;Isa 29:13). See also note on&nbsp;Mt 15:2ff.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28828b"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 7:4&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Moses had prescribed a few ablutions for priests when they prepared for service at the altar (Ex 30:17-21). However, Rabbinic tradition had gone beyond the spirit of this prescription and arbitrarily extended it. Jesus condemns this Pharisaic formalism and censures his opponents who out of love for their traditions had nullified the more important commandments of the Law. His disciples&mdash;like the great majority of the common people&mdash;paid little attention to these prescriptions of the Pharisees.&nbsp;<em>And tables:</em>&nbsp;found only in some early manucripts.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28832c"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 7:8&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><em>The commandment of God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the traditions of men:</em>&nbsp;Jesus makes a clear contrast between the two. The commandment of God is found in Scripture and is binding; the traditions of men (also known as the tradition of the elders: v.&nbsp;3) are not found in Scripture and are not binding.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28835d"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 7:11&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><em>Corban:</em>&nbsp;an Aramaic word meaning &ldquo;offered to God.&rdquo;</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28838e"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 7:14&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Jesus settles the question of clean and unclean foods that was erecting a barrier between Jews and pagans and was troubling Jews who had converted to Christianity (see&nbsp;Acts 10:11,&nbsp;15;&nbsp;Rom 14:14-23;&nbsp;1&nbsp;Tim 4:3-4;&nbsp;Tit 1:15). See also note on&nbsp;Mt 15:10-20.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28840f"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 7:16&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">This verse is lacking in some of the most ancient manuscripts; it was probably added here from&nbsp;Mk 4:9&nbsp;or&nbsp;4:23.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28848g"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 7:24&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">See notes on&nbsp;Mt 15:21-28&nbsp;and&nbsp;15:21-22.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28855h"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 7:31&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">The miracle of the deaf mute is omitted by the other evangelists. This man may also have been a pagan, for the population of the Decapolis was mostly pagan. The various gestures that Jesus performs on the man had the sole purpose of strengthening his faith. Mark might have recounted them in detail to foreshadow the future Christian Sacraments.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28862i"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">See note on&nbsp;Mt 15:29-39.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28871j"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:10&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><em>Dalmanutha:</em>&nbsp;location unknown.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28872k"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:11&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">See note on&nbsp;Mt 16:1-4.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28875l"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:14&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">See note on&nbsp;Mt 16:5-12.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28883m"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:22&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Jesus&rsquo; actions and the healing of the blind man seem to have the same purpose as his actions and the healing of the deaf mute (see&nbsp;Mk 7:3-37). Some scholars regard both healings as a means of expressing the gradual enlightenment of the disciples about Jesus&rsquo; Messiahship.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28888n"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:27&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Many scholars believe that Peter&rsquo;s confession of Jesus&rsquo; Messiahship constitutes the central point of this Gospel. It is the decisive doctrinal turning point in which we have the end of the Messianic Secret. Up to this point Jesus demanded the greatest secrecy about the mystery of his person. Henceforth, Jesus utters repeated exhortations concerning the following of the Messiah.<br>The apostles had recognized the Messiah through Peter&rsquo;s confession in spite of the humble and insignificant appearances of their Master&rsquo;s public activity. Now they must cling with faith to the suffering Messiah and accept the scandal of the cross.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28892o"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:31&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Where are we to find the revelation that God wants to communicate to humanity? We must look to the cross, understand and share the condition of Jesus, and answer the call that he gives us to follow him. It is a suffering and humiliated Christ who saves the human race. Of this Mark is certain.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28892p"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:31&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">It is with full awareness and deliberation that Jesus sets out toward the fulfillment of his mission. He speaks on three occasions of the way of suffering and humiliation that he sees opening before him, and on all three occasions he encounters closed minds.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28892q"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:31&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">See notes on&nbsp;Mt 16:21&nbsp;and&nbsp;16:22-23.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28892r"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:31&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><em>The elders, the chief priests, and the scribes:</em>&nbsp;the members of the Sanhedrin.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28895s"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:34&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">See note on&nbsp;Mt 16:25.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28896t"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 8:35&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">The Greek word for &ldquo;life&rdquo; can also mean &ldquo;soul.&rdquo; &ldquo;Life&rdquo; is used in a double sense&mdash;earthly life and eternal life.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28900u"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><em>Come with power:</em>&nbsp;the reference is to the new age of humanity that begins with the death of Jesus.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28901v"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:2&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">See notes on&nbsp;Mt 17:1-8&nbsp;and&nbsp;17:1.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28908w"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:9&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">See note on&nbsp;Mt 17:9-13.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28913x"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:14&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">See note on&nbsp;Mt 17:14-21.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28928y"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:29&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Other ancient manuscripts omit: &ldquo;and by fasting.&rdquo;</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28929z"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:30&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Mark very effectively alternates the glorious and suffering aspects of the Messiah, following up the most spectacular exorcism in the Gospel with Jesus&rsquo; second prediction of his Passion. He also implies that the initiative for the death of the Servant (see&nbsp;Isa 53) belongs to God.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28930aa"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:31&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><em>Son of Man:</em>&nbsp;see note on&nbsp;Mt 8:20.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28932ab"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:33&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">This incident and the sayings that follow it are most likely intended to be a commentary on the lack of understanding exhibited by the disciples. They are to serve the poor and lowly. Jesus used children as the symbol for the&nbsp;<em>anawim</em>, the poor in spirit, i.e., the lowly in the Christian community.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28937ac"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:38&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><em>Not one of us:</em>&nbsp;though the man was not one of the Twelve, he was a believer in Jesus and acted in his name. Therefore, Jesus counsels the Twelve that they should not oppose him.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28941ad"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:42&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">See note on&nbsp;Mt 18:5-11.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28942ae"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:43&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><em>Cut it off:</em>&nbsp;Jesus is here using hyperbole, a figure of speech that exaggerates to make a point. He means that sometimes sin can be overcome only by taking drastic action.&nbsp;<em>Gehenna:</em>&nbsp;the name, from the Hebrew&nbsp;<em>Ge Hinnon</em>, of a small valley southwest of Jerusalem; it was a popular image for hell because of the refuse that was continually burned there.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28943af"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:44&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">These verses are omitted in the best manuscripts; they are repetitions of v.&nbsp;48&nbsp;(see&nbsp;Isa 66:24).</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-28948ag"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mark 9:49&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">This somewhat obscure verse was perhaps introduced because of the reference to fire in v.&nbsp;48. Fire signifies the testing that precedes God&rsquo;s judgment (see&nbsp;1&nbsp;Cor 3:13-15). Salt, a symbol of fidelity, was sprinkled on sacrificial victims so that they might be pleasing to God (Lev 2:13). When the testing is endured with fidelity, it makes the believer acceptable to God.</span></span></li>
