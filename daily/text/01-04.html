<li id=3D"fen-EASY-12776a"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">1:6&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">When we write&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&nbsp;like this, it is a special name for God. Sometimes people write it as &lsquo;Yahweh&rsquo;, or as &lsquo;Jehovah&rsquo;. It is his own name that he told Moses. See&nbsp;Exodus 3:14. It means &lsquo;I am who I am&rsquo;. This shows that God has always been there and he always will be there.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-EASY-12782b"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">1:12&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Some of the events in this part of the book happen in heaven. Job does not know about these events. So he does not know why all the bad things have happened to him.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-EASY-12806c"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">3:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Job does not understand why these bad things have happened to him. He thinks that God is not fair. He has so much trouble and pain that he wants to die.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-EASY-12832d"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">4:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Now Job's friend Eliphaz tries to explain to Job why bad things have happened. He says that God is kind to good people and he punishes people who are bad. So if bad things have happened, Job must have done wrong things.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-EASY-12842e"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">4:11&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Eliphaz says that God will destroy wicked people, even if they are very strong.</span></span></li>
