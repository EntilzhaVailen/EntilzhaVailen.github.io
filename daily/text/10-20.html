<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1327" class=3D"text John-10-1-John-10-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus declares himself the true shepherd of men</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span class=3D"text John-10-1-John-10-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">10&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-5&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus said, &ldquo;Believe me when I tell you that anyone who does not enter the sheepfold though the door, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a rogue. It is the shepherd of the flock who goes in by the door. It is to him the door-keeper opens the door and it is his voice that the sheep recognise. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out of the fold, and when he has driven all his own flock outside, he goes in front of them himself, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. They will never follow a stranger&mdash;indeed, they will run away from him, for they do not recognise strange voices.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1328" class=3D"text John-10-6-John-10-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">6-15&nbsp;</sup>Jesus gave them this illustration but they did not grasp the point of what he was saying to them. So Jesus said to them once more, &ldquo;I do assure you that I myself am the door for the sheep. All who have gone before me are like thieves and rogues, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If a man goes in through me, he will be safe and sound; he can come in and out and find his food. The thief comes with the sole intention of stealing and killing and destroying, but I came to bring them life, and far more life than before. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd will give his life for the sake of his sheep. But the hired man, who is not the shepherd, and does not own the sheep, will see the wolf coming, desert the sheep and run away. And the wolf will attack the flock and send them flying. The hired man runs away because he is only a hired man and has no interest in the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and I know those that are mine and my sheep know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I am giving my life for the sake of the sheep.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1329" class=3D"text John-10-16-John-10-18" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">16-18&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;And I have other sheep who do not belong to this fold. I must lead these also, and they will hear my voice. So there will be one flock and one shepherd. This is the reason why the Father loves me&mdash;that I lay down my life, and I lay it down to take it up again! No one is taking it from me, but I lay it down of my own free will. I have the power to lay it down and I have the power to take it up again. This is an order that I have received from my Father.&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1330" class=3D"text John-10-19-John-10-20" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus plainly declares who he is</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text John-10-19-John-10-20" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">19-20&nbsp;</sup>Once again, the Jews were in two minds about him because of these words, many of them remarking, &ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s in him and he&rsquo;s insane. Why do you listen to him?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1331" class=3D"text John-10-21" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>But others were saying, &ldquo;This is not the sort of thing a devil-possessed man would say! Can a devil make a blind man see?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1332" class=3D"text John-10-22-John-10-24" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">22-24&nbsp;</sup>Then came the dedication festival at Jerusalem. It was winter-time and Jesus was walking about inside the Temple in Solomon&rsquo;s cloisters. So the Jews closed in on him and said, &ldquo;How much longer are you going to keep us in suspense? If you really are Christ, tell us so straight out!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1333" class=3D"text John-10-25-John-10-30" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">25-30&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; replied Jesus, &ldquo;and you do not believe it. What I have done in my Father&rsquo;s name is sufficient to prove my claim, but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. My sheep recognise my voice and I know who they are. They follow me and I give them eternal life. They will never die and no one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. And no one can tear anything out of the Father&rsquo;s hand. I and the Father are One.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1334" class=3D"text John-10-31-John-10-32" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">31-32&nbsp;</sup>Again the Jews reached for stones to stone him to death, but Jesus answered them, &ldquo;I have shown you many good things from the Father&mdash;for which of these do you intend to stone me?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1335" class=3D"text John-10-33" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to stone you for any good things,&rdquo; replied the Jews, &ldquo;but for blasphemy: because you, who are only a man, are making yourself out to be God.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1336" class=3D"text John-10-34-John-10-38" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">34-38&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Is it not written in your own Law,&rdquo; replied Jesus, &ldquo;&lsquo;I have said you are gods&rsquo;? And if he called these men &lsquo;gods&rsquo; to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken), can you say to the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world, &lsquo;You are blaspheming&rsquo; because I said, &lsquo;I am the Son of God&rsquo;? If I fail to do what my Father does, then do not believe me. But if I do, even though you have no faith in me personally, then believe in the things that I do. Then you may come to know and realise that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1337" class=3D"text John-10-39" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>And again they tried to arrest him, but he moved out of their reach.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1338" class=3D"text John-10-40-John-10-41" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">40-41&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus went off again across the Jordan to the place where John had first baptised and there he stayed. A great many people came to him, and said, &ldquo;John never gave us any sign but all that he said about this man was true.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1339" class=3D"text John-10-42" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>And in that place many believed in him.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1340" class=3D"text John-11-1-John-11-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus shows his power over death</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span class=3D"text John-11-1-John-11-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">11&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-3&nbsp;</sup>Now there was a man by the name of Lazarus who became seriously ill. He lived in Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived. (Lazarus was the brother of the Mary who poured perfume upon the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.) So the sisters sent word to Jesus: &ldquo;Lord, your friend is ill.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1341" class=3D"text John-11-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus received the message, he said, &ldquo;This illness is not meant to end in death; it is going to bring glory to God&mdash;for it will show the glory of the Son of God.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1342" class=3D"text John-11-5-John-11-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5-7&nbsp;</sup>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. So when he heard of Lazarus&rsquo; illness he stayed where he was two days longer. Only then did he say to the disciples, &ldquo;Let us go back into Judea.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1343" class=3D"text John-11-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo; returned the disciples, &ldquo;only a few days ago, the Jews were trying to stone you to death&mdash;are you going there again?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1344" class=3D"text John-11-9-John-11-10" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;There are twelve hours of daylight every day, are there not?&rdquo; replied Jesus. &ldquo;If a man walks in the daytime, he does not stumble, for he has the daylight to see by. But if he walks at night he stumbles, because he cannot see where he is going.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1345" class=3D"text John-11-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Jesus spoke these words; then after a pause he said to them, &ldquo;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going to wake him up.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1346" class=3D"text John-11-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>At this, his disciples said, &ldquo;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will be all right.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1347" class=3D"text John-11-13-John-11-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">13-15&nbsp;</sup>Actually Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about falling into natural sleep. This made Jesus tell them quite plainly, &ldquo;Lazarus has died, and I am glad that I was not there&mdash;for your sakes, that you may learn to believe. And now, let us go to him.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1348" class=3D"text John-11-16" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Thomas (known as the twin) then said to his fellow-disciples, &ldquo;Come on, then, let us all go and die with him!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1349" class=3D"text John-11-17-John-11-20" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">17-20&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the grave four days. Now Bethany is quite near Jerusalem, rather less than two miles away, and a good many of the Jews had come out to see Martha and Mary to offer them sympathy over their brother&rsquo;s death. When Martha heard that Jesus was on his way, she went out and met him, while Mary stayed in the house.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1350" class=3D"text John-11-21-John-11-22" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">21-22&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If only you had been here, Lord,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;my brother would never have died. And I know that, even now, God will give you whatever you ask from him.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1351" class=3D"text John-11-23" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Your brother will rise again,&rdquo; Jesus replied to her.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1352" class=3D"text John-11-24" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1353" class=3D"text John-11-25-John-11-26" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">25-26&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I myself am the resurrection and the life,&rdquo; Jesus told her. &ldquo;The man who believes in me will live even though he dies, and anyone who is alive and believes in me will never die at all. Can you believe that?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1354" class=3D"text John-11-27-John-11-31" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">27-31&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Yes, Lord,&rdquo; replied Martha. &ldquo;I do believe that you are Christ, the Son of God, the one who was to come into the world.&rdquo; Saying this she went away and called Mary her sister, whispering, &ldquo;The master&rsquo;s here and is asking for you.&rdquo; When Mary heard this she sprang to her feet and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet arrived at the village itself, but was still where Martha had met him. So when the Jews who had been condoling with Mary in the house saw her get up quickly and go out, they followed her, imagining that she was going to the grave to weep there.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1355" class=3D"text John-11-32" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>When Mary met Jesus, she looked at him, and then fell down at his feet. &ldquo;If only you had been here, Lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my brother would never have died.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1356" class=3D"text John-11-33" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus saw Mary weep and noticed the tears of the Jews who came with her, he was deeply moved and visibly distressed.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1357" class=3D"text John-11-34" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Where have you put him?&rdquo; he asked.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1358" class=3D"text John-11-35" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Lord, come and see,&rdquo; they replied, and at this Jesus himself wept.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1359" class=3D"text John-11-36-John-11-37" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">36-37&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Look how much he loved him!&rdquo; remarked the Jews, though some of them asked, &ldquo;Could he not have kept this man from dying if he could open that blind man&rsquo;s eyes?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1360" class=3D"text John-11-38" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Jesus was again deeply moved at these words, and went on to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay in front of it.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1361" class=3D"text John-11-39" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Take away the stone,&rdquo; said Jesus. &ldquo;But Lord,&rdquo; said Martha, the dead man&rsquo;s sister, &ldquo;he has been dead four days. By this time he will be decaying ....&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1362" class=3D"text John-11-40" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Did I not tell you,&rdquo; replied Jesus, &ldquo;that if you believed, you would see the wonder of what God can do?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1363" class=3D"text John-11-41-John-11-42" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">41-42&nbsp;</sup>Then they took the stone away and Jesus raised his eyes and said, &ldquo;Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I know that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of these people standing here so that they may believe that you have sent me.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1364" class=3D"text John-11-43" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>And when he had said this, he called out in a loud voice, &ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1365" class=3D"text John-11-44" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">44&nbsp;</sup>And the dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with grave-clothes and his face muffled with a handkerchief. &ldquo;Now unbind him,&rdquo; Jesus told them, &ldquo;and let him go home.&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1366" class=3D"text John-11-45-John-11-48" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus&rsquo; miracle leads to deadly hostility</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text John-11-45-John-11-48" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">45-48&nbsp;</sup>After this many of the Jews who had accompanied Mary and observed what Jesus did, believed in him. But some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. Consequently, the Pharisees and chief priests summoned the council and said, &ldquo;What can we do? This man obviously shows many remarkable signs. If we let him go on doing this sort of thing we shall have everybody believing in him. Then we shall have the Romans coming and that will be the end of our holy place and our very existence as a nation.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1367" class=3D"text John-11-49-John-11-56" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">49-56&nbsp;</sup>But one of them, Caiaphas, who was High Priest that year, addressed the meeting: &ldquo;You plainly don&rsquo;t understand what is involved here. You do not realise that it would be a good thing for us if one man should die for the sake of the people&mdash;instead of the whole nation being destroyed.&rdquo; (He did not make this remark on his own initiative but, since he was High Priest that year, he was in fact inspired to say that Jesus was going to die for the nation&rsquo;s sake&mdash;and in fact not for that nation only, but to bring together into one family all the children of God scattered throughout the world.) From that day then, they planned to kill him. As a consequence Jesus made no further public appearance among the Jews but went away to the countryside on the edge of the desert, and stayed with his disciples in a town called Ephraim. The Jewish Passover was approaching and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem before the actual Passover, to go through a ceremonial cleansing. They were looking for Jesus there and kept saying to one another as they stood in the Temple, &ldquo;What do you think? Surely he won&rsquo;t come to the festival?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1368" class=3D"text John-11-57" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">57&nbsp;</sup>It should be understood that the chief priests and the Pharisees had issued an order that anyone who knew of Jesus&rsquo; whereabouts should tell them, so they could arrest him.</span></div>
