<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2813" class=3D"text Rev-9-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The fifth trumpet: The fathomless pit</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span class=3D"text Rev-9-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">9&nbsp;</span>The fifth angel blew his trumpet. I saw a star, that had fallen down from Heaven to earth, and he was given the key to the fathomless pit.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2814" class=3D"text Rev-9-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Then he opened the pit and smoke like the smoke of a vast furnace rose out of it, so that the light of the sun and the air itself grew dark from the smoke of the pit.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2815" class=3D"text Rev-9-3-Rev-9-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">3-5&nbsp;</sup>Then out of the smoke emerged locusts to descend upon the earth. They were given powers like those of earthly scorpions. They had orders to do no harm to any grass, green thing or tree upon the earth, but to injure only those human beings who did not bear the seal of God upon their foreheads. They were given no power to kill men, but only to torture them for five months. The torture they could inflict was like the pain of a scorpion&rsquo;s sting.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2816" class=3D"text Rev-9-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>In those days men will seek death but they will never find it; they will long to die but death will elude them.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2817" class=3D"text Rev-9-7-Rev-9-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7-11&nbsp;</sup>These locusts looked to me in my vision like horses prepared for battle, On their heads were what appeared to be crowns like gold; their faces were like human faces, and they had long hair like women. Their teeth were like lion&rsquo;s teeth, their breasts were like iron-breastplates, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of a host of chariots and horses charging into battle. They have tails and stings like scorpions, and it is in their tails that they possess the power to injure men for five months. They have as their king the angel of the pit, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek Apollyon, (meaning the destroyer).</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2818" class=3D"text Rev-9-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>The first disaster is now past, but I see two more approaching.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2819" class=3D"text Rev-9-13-Rev-9-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The sixth trumpet: the destroying angels</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Rev-9-13-Rev-9-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">13-14&nbsp;</sup>Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a solitary voice speaking from the four corners of the golden altar that stands in the presence of God. And it said to the sixth angel who held the trumpet, &ldquo;Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2820" class=3D"text Rev-9-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Then these four angels who had been held ready for the hour, the day, the month and the year, were set free to kill a third-part of all mankind.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2821" class=3D"text Rev-9-16-Rev-9-19" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">16-19&nbsp;</sup>The number of their horsemen was two hundred million&mdash;I heard what their number was. In my vision I saw these horses and their riders, and their breastplates were fiery-red, blue and yellow. The horses&rsquo; heads looked to me like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths poured fire and smoke and sulphur. A third of all mankind died from the fearful effects of these three, the fire, the smoke and the sulphur which pours out of their mouths. For the power of these horses lies in their mouths and in their tails. Indeed their tails are like serpents with heads, and with these they inflict injury.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2822" class=3D"text Rev-9-20-Rev-9-21" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">20-21&nbsp;</sup>The rest of mankind, who did not die in this fearful destruction, neither repented of the works of their own hands nor ceased to worship evil powers and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone or wood, which can neither see nor hear nor move. Neither did they repent of their murders, their sorceries, their sexual sins, nor of their thieving.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2823" class=3D"text Rev-10-1-Rev-10-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The angel with the little book</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span class=3D"text Rev-10-1-Rev-10-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">10&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-4&nbsp;</sup>Then I saw another mighty angel descending from Heaven. He was clothed in a cloud, and there was a rainbow around his head. His face blazed like the sun, his legs like pillars of fire, and he had a little book lying open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land, and then shouted with a loud voice like the roar of a lion. And when he shouted the seven thunders lifted their voices. When the seven thunders had rolled I was on the point of writing but I heard a voice from heaven, saying, &ldquo;Seal up what the seven thunders said, but do not write it down!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2824" class=3D"text Rev-10-5-Rev-10-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5-7&nbsp;</sup>Then the angel whom I had seen bestriding the sea and the land raised his right hand to Heaven and swore by the living one of the timeless ages, who created Heaven, earth and sea and all that is in them: &ldquo;There shall be no more delay! In the days which shall soon be announced by the trumpet-blast of the seventh angel the mysterious purpose of God shall be completed, as he assured his servants the prophets.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2825" class=3D"text Rev-10-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Then the voice which I had heard from Heaven was again in my ears, saying, &ldquo;Go, and take the little book which lies open in the hand of the angel whose feet are planted on both sea and land.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2826" class=3D"text Rev-10-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>So I went off towards the angel, asking him to give me the little book. &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;and eat it up. It will be bitter to your stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2827" class=3D"text Rev-10-10" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Then I took the little book from the angel&rsquo;s hand and swallowed it. It was as sweet as honey to the taste but when I had eaten it up it was bitter to my stomach.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2828" class=3D"text Rev-10-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">John is instructed to prophesy</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Rev-10-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Then they said to me, &ldquo;It is again your duty to prophesy about many peoples, nations, languages and kings.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2829" class=3D"text Rev-11-1-Rev-11-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">11&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-2&nbsp;</sup>And I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, &ldquo;Get up and measure the Temple of God, and the altar, and count those who worship there. But leave out of your measurement the courtyard outside the Temple&mdash;do not measure that at all. For it has been given over to the nations, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months.&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2830" class=3D"text Rev-11-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">God&rsquo;s two witnesses</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Rev-11-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;And I will give authority to my two witnesses to proclaim the message, clothed in sackcloth for twelve hundred and sixty days.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2831" class=3D"text Rev-11-4-Rev-11-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">4-6&nbsp;</sup>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth. If anyone tries to harm them, fire issues from their mouths and consumes their enemies. Indeed, if anyone should try to hurt them, this is the way in which he will certainly meet his death. These witnesses have power to shut up the sky and stop any rain from falling during the time of their preaching. Moreover, they have power to turn the waters into blood, and to strike the earth with any plague as often as they wish.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2832" class=3D"text Rev-11-7-Rev-11-10" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The emergence of the animal</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Rev-11-7-Rev-11-10" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7-10&nbsp;</sup>Then, when their work of witness is complete, the animal will come up out of the pit and go to war with them. It will conquer and kill them, and their bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which is called by those with spiritual understanding, &ldquo;Sodom&rdquo; and &ldquo;Egypt&rdquo;&mdash;the very place where their Lord himself was crucified. For three and a half days men from all people and tribes and languages and nations will gaze upon their bodies and will not allow them to be buried. The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will hold celebrations and send one another presents, because these two prophets had brought such misery to the inhabitants of the earth.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2833" class=3D"text Rev-11-11-Rev-11-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The resurrection and ascension of the two witnesses</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Rev-11-11-Rev-11-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">11-12&nbsp;</sup>But after three and a half days the Spirit of life from God entered them and they stood upright on their feet. This struck terror into the hearts of those who were watching them, and they heard a tremendous voice speaking to these two from Heaven, saying &ldquo;Come up here!&rdquo; And they went up to Heaven in a cloud in full view of their enemies.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2834" class=3D"text Rev-11-13" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>And at that moment there was a great earthquake, a tenth-part of the city fell in ruins and seven thousand people were known to have been killed in the earthquake. The rest were terrified and acknowledged the glory of the God of Heaven.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2835" class=3D"text Rev-11-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The seventh trumpet: (i) the worship of Heaven</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Rev-11-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>The second disaster is now past, and I see the third disaster following hard upon the heels of the second.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2836" class=3D"text Rev-11-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>The seventh angel blew his trumpet. There arose loud voices in Heaven and they were saying, &ldquo;The kingship of the world now belongs to our Lord and to his Christ, and he shall be king for timeless ages!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2837" class=3D"text Rev-11-16-Rev-11-18" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">16-18&nbsp;</sup>Then the twenty-four elders, who sit upon their thrones in the presence of God, prostrated themselves and, with bowed heads, worshipped God, saying: &ldquo;We give you thanks, O Lord God Almighty, the one who is and who was and who is to come, because you have taken your great power and reigned. The nations were angry, and your wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should reward your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2838" class=3D"text Rev-11-19" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Then the Temple of God in Heaven was thrown open and the ark of his agreement within his Temple could be clearly seen. Accompanying this sight were flashes of lightning, loud noises, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a violent storm of hail.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2839" class=3D"text Rev-12-1-Rev-12-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The seventh trumpet: (ii) The sign of the woman</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span class=3D"text Rev-12-1-Rev-12-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">12&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-2&nbsp;</sup>Then a huge sign became visible in the sky&mdash;the figure of a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars upon her head. She was pregnant, and cried out in her labour and in the pains of bringing forth her child.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2840" class=3D"text Rev-12-3-Rev-12-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The seventh trumpet: (iii) The dragon, the enemy of the woman</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Rev-12-3-Rev-12-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">3-4&nbsp;</sup>Then another sign became visible in the sky, and I saw that it was a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, with a diadem upon each of his heads. His tail swept down a third of the stars in the sky and hurled them upon the earth. The dragon took his place in front of the woman who was about to give birth to a child, so that as soon as she did so he might devour it.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2841" class=3D"text Rev-12-5-Rev-12-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5-6&nbsp;</sup>She gave birth to a male child who is to shepherd all the nations &ldquo;with a rod of iron&rdquo;. Her child was snatched up to God and to his throne, while the woman fled into the desert where she has a place prepared for her by God&rsquo;s command. There they will take care of her for twelve hundred and sixty days.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2842" class=3D"text Rev-12-7-Rev-12-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">War in Heaven</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Rev-12-7-Rev-12-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7-9&nbsp;</sup>The war broke out in Heaven. Michael and his angels battled with the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they did not prevail and they were expelled from Heaven. So the huge dragon, the serpent of ancient times, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world, was hurled down upon the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2843" class=3D"text Rev-12-10-Rev-12-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The victory of Heaven proclaimed</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Rev-12-10-Rev-12-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">10-11&nbsp;</sup>Then I heard a great voice in Heaven cry: &ldquo;Now the salvation and the power and kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ have come! For the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down from this place, where he stood before our God accusing them day and night. Now they have conquered him through the blood of the Lamb, and through the Word to which they bore witness. They did not cherish life even in the face of death!</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2844" class=3D"text Rev-12-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Therefore, rejoice, O Heavens, and all you who live in the Heavens! But alas for the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you in great fury, knowing that his time is short!&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2845" class=3D"text Rev-12-13-Rev-12-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The dragon&rsquo;s enmity against the woman</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Rev-12-13-Rev-12-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">13-14&nbsp;</sup>And when the dragon saw that he had been cast down upon the earth, he began to pursue the woman who had given birth to the male child. But she was given two great eagle&rsquo;s wings so that she could fly to her place in the desert, where she is kept safe from the serpent for a time and times and half a time.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-2846" class=3D"text Rev-12-15-Rev-12-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15-17&nbsp;</sup>Then the serpent ejected water from his mouth, streaming like a river in pursuit of the woman, to drown her in its flood. But the earth came to the woman&rsquo;s rescue, opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon had emitted from his mouth. Then the dragon raged with fury against the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her children&mdash;those who keep the commandments of God and bear their witness to Jesus.</span></div>
