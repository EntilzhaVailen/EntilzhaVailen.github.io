<h3><span id=3D"en-NLV-5681" class=3D"text Deut-29-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The Agreement in Moab</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span class=3D"text Deut-29-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">29&nbsp;</span>These are the words of the agreement the Lord told Moses to make with the people of Israel in the land of Moab, as well as the agreement He had made with them at Mount Sinai.</span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-5682" class=3D"text Deut-29-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Moses called all Israel and said to them, &ldquo;You have seen all the Lord did in front of you in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and all his servants and all his land. </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5683" class=3D"text Deut-29-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>You have seen great tests and powerful works. </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5684" class=3D"text Deut-29-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Yet to this day the Lord has not given you a heart to know, or eyes to see, or ears to hear. </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5685" class=3D"text Deut-29-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>I have led you forty years in the desert. Your clothes did not wear out. And your shoes did not wear out on your feet. </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5686" class=3D"text Deut-29-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>You did not eat bread, or drink wine or strong drink, so you might know that I am the Lord your God. </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5687" class=3D"text Deut-29-7"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came to meet us to fight. But we won the fight. </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5688" class=3D"text Deut-29-8"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>We took their land and gave it as a gift to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half family group of Manasseh. </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5689" class=3D"text Deut-29-9"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>So be careful to keep the words of this agreement and obey them so all that you do will go well.</span></span></div>

Why was He so angry?&rsquo; </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5705" class=3D"text Deut-29-25"><sup class=3D"versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Then men will say, &lsquo;It is because they did not keep the agreement of the Lord, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt. </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5706" class=3D"text Deut-29-26"><sup class=3D"versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>They went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods they had not known and whom He had not given to them. </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5707" class=3D"text Deut-29-27"><sup class=3D"versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>So the anger of the Lord burned against that land. Every curse was brought upon it that is written in this book. </span> <span id=3D"en-NLV-5708" class=3D"text Deut-29-28"><sup class=3D"versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>The Lord drove them from their land in much anger.
