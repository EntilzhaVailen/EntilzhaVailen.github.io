<h3><span class=3D"text Acts-1-1-Acts-1-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Introduction</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span class=3D"text Acts-1-1-Acts-1-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">1&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-3&nbsp;</sup>My Dear Theophilus, In my first book I gave you some account of all that Jesus began to do and teach until the time of his ascension. Before he ascended he gave his instructions, through the Holy Spirit, to the special messengers of his choice. For after his suffering he showed himself alive to them in many convincing ways, and appeared to them repeatedly over a period of forty days talking with them about the affairs of the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<h3><span class=3D"text Acts-1-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus&rsquo; parting words before his ascension</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>On one occasion, while he was eating a meal with them, he emphasised that they were not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the Father&rsquo;s promise.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You have already heard me speak about this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for John used to baptise with water, but before many days are passed you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>This naturally brought them all together, and they asked him, &ldquo;Lord, is this the time when you are going to restore the kingdom to Israel?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-7-Acts-1-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7-8&nbsp;</sup>To this he replied, &ldquo;You cannot know times and dates which have been fixed by the Father&rsquo;s sole authority. But you are to be given power when the Holy Spirit has come to you. You will be witnesses to me, not only in Jerusalem, not only throughout Judea, not only in Samaria, but to the very ends of the earth!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-9-Acts-1-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9-11&nbsp;</sup>When he had said these words he was lifted up before their eyes till a cloud hid him from their sight. While they were still gazing up into the sky as he went, suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them and said, &ldquo;Men of Galilee, why are you standing here looking up into the sky? This very Jesus who has been taken up from you into Heaven will come back in just the same way as you have seen him go.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-12-Acts-1-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12-14&nbsp;</sup>At this they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives which is near the city, only a sabbath day&rsquo;s journey away. On entering Jerusalem they went straight to the upstairs room where they had been staying. There were Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Patriot, and Judas the son of James. By common consent all these men together with the women who had followed Jesus, Mary his mother as well as his brothers devoted themselves to prayer.</span></div>
<h3><span class=3D"text Acts-1-15-Acts-1-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Judas&rsquo; place is filled</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-15-Acts-1-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15-17&nbsp;</sup>It was during this period that Peter stood among the brothers&mdash;there were about a hundred and twenty present at the time&mdash;and said, &ldquo;My brothers, the prophecy of scripture given through the Holy Spirit by the lips of David concerning Judas was bound to come true. He was the man who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus, though he was one of our number and he had a share in this ministry of ours.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-18-Acts-1-19" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">18-19&nbsp;</sup>(This man had bought a piece of land with the proceeds of his infamy, but his body swelled up and his intestines burst. This fact became well known to all the residents of Jerusalem so that the piece of land came to be called in their Aramaic language Akeldama, which means &ldquo;the field of blood&rdquo;.)</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-20" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Now it is written in the book of psalms of such a man: &lsquo;Let his habitation be desolate, and let no one live in it&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Let another take his office&rsquo;.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-21-Acts-1-22" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">21-22&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;It becomes necessary then that whoever joins us must be someone who has been in our company during the whole time the Lord Jesus lived his life with us, from the beginning when John baptised him until the day when he was taken up from us. This man must be an eye-witness with us to the resurrection of Jesus.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-1-23-Acts-1-26" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">23-26&nbsp;</sup>Two men were put forward, Joseph called Barsabbas who was also called Justus and Matthias. Then they prayed, &ldquo;You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two you have chosen to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.&rdquo; Then they drew lots for these men, and the lot fell to Matthias, and thereafter he was considered equally an apostle with the eleven.</span></div>
<h3><span class=3D"text Acts-2-1-Acts-2-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The first Pentecost for the young Church</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span class=3D"text Acts-2-1-Acts-2-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">2&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-4&nbsp;</sup>Then when the actual day of Pentecost came they were all assembled together. Suddenly there was a sound from heaven like the rushing of a violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were seated. Before their eyes appeared tongues like flames which separated off and settled above the head of each one of them. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different languages as the Spirit gave them power to proclaim his message.</span></div>
<h3><span class=3D"text Acts-2-5-Acts-2-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The Church&rsquo;s first impact on devout Jews</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-5-Acts-2-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5-11&nbsp;</sup>Now there were staying in Jerusalem Jews of deep faith from every nation of the world. When they heard this sound a crowd quickly collected and were completely bewildered because each one of them heard these men speaking in his own language. They were absolutely amazed and said in their astonishment, &ldquo;Listen, surely all these speakers are Galileans? Then how does it happen that every single one of us can hear the particular language he has known from a child? There are Parthians, Medes and Elamites; there are men whose homes are in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Africa near Cyrene, as well as visitors from Rome! There are Jews and proselytes, men from Crete and men from Arabia, yet we can all hear these men speaking of the magnificence of God in our native language.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Everyone was utterly amazed and did not know what to make of it, Indeed they kept saying to each other, &ldquo;What on earth can this mean?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-13" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>But there were others who laughed mockingly and said, &ldquo;These fellows have drunk too much new wine!&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span class=3D"text Acts-2-14-Acts-2-21" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Peter explains the fulfilment of God&rsquo;s promise</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-14-Acts-2-21" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">14-21&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter, with the eleven standing by him, raised his voice and addressed them: &ldquo;Fellow Jews, and all who are living in Jerusalem, listen carefully to what I say while I explain to you what has happened! These men are not drunk as you suppose&mdash;it is after all only nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning of this great feast day. No, this is something which was predicted by the prophet Joel, &lsquo;And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams. And on my menservants and on my maidservants I will pour out my Spirit in those days and they shall prophesy. I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath: blood and fire and vapour of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and notable day of the Lord. And it shall come to pass that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rsquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-22-Acts-2-28" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">22-28&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Men of Israel, I beg you to listen to my words. Jesus of Nazareth was a man proved to you by God himself through the works of power, the miracles and the signs which God showed through him here amongst you&mdash;as you very well know. This man, who was put into your power by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed up and murdered, and you used for your purpose men without the Law! But God would not allow the bitter pains of death to touch him. He raised him to life again&mdash;and indeed there was nothing by which death could hold such a man. When David speaks about him he says, &lsquo;I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken; therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad; moreover my flesh will also rest in hope, because you will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will you allow your holy one to see corruption. You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of joy in your presence.&rsquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-29-Acts-2-35" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">29-35&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Men and brother-Jews, I can surely speak freely to you about the patriarch David. There is no doubt that he died and was buried, and his grave is here among us to this day. But while he was alive he was a prophet. He knew that God had given him a most solemn promise that he would place one of his descendants upon his throne. He foresaw the resurrection of Christ, and it is this of which he is speaking. Christ was not deserted in death and his body was never destroyed. &lsquo;Christ is the man Jesus, whom God raised up&mdash;a fact of which all of us are eye-witnesses!&rsquo; He has been raised to the right hand of God; he has received from the Father and poured out upon us the promised Holy Spirit&mdash;that is what you now see and hear! David never ascended to Heaven, but he certainly said, &lsquo;The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool&rsquo;.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-36" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Now therefore the whole nation of Israel must know beyond the shadow of a doubt that this Jesus, whom you crucified, God has declared to be both Lord and Christ.&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span class=3D"text Acts-2-37" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The reaction to Peter&rsquo;s speech</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-37" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>When they heard this they were cut to the quick, and they cried to Peter and the other apostles, &ldquo;Men and fellow-Jews, what shall we do now?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-38-Acts-2-39" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">38-39&nbsp;</sup>Peter told them, &ldquo;You must repent and every one of you must be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ, so that you may have your sins forgiven and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For this great promise is for you and your children&mdash;yes, and for all who are far away, for as many as the Lord our God shall call to himself!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-40" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>Peter said much more than this as he gave his testimony and implored them, saying, &ldquo;Save yourselves from this perverted generation!&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span class=3D"text Acts-2-41-Acts-2-42" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The first large-scale conversion</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-41-Acts-2-42" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">41-42&nbsp;</sup>Then those who welcomed his message were baptised, and on that day alone about three thousand souls were added to the number of disciples. They continued steadily learning the teaching of the apostles, and joined in their fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayer.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-2-43-Acts-2-47" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">43-47&nbsp;</sup>Everyone felt a deep sense of awe, while many miracles and signs took place through the apostles. All the believers shared everything in common; they sold their possessions and goods and divided the proceeds among the fellowship according to individual need. Day after day they met by common consent in the Temple; they broke bread together in their homes, sharing meals with simple joy. They praised God continually and all the people respected them. Every day the Lord added to their number those who were finding salvation.</span></div>
<h3><span class=3D"text Acts-3-1-Acts-3-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">A public miracle and its explanation</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span class=3D"text Acts-3-1-Acts-3-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">3&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-4&nbsp;</sup>One afternoon Peter and John were on their way to the Temple for the three o&rsquo;clock hour of prayer. A man who had been lame from birth was being carried along in the crowd, for it was the daily practice to put him down at what was known as the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, so that he could beg from the people as they went in. As this man saw Peter and John just about to enter he asked them to give him something. Peter looked intently at the man and so did John. Then Peter said, &ldquo;Look straight at us!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-3-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>The man looked at them expectantly, hoping that they would give him something.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-3-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If you are expecting silver or gold,&rdquo; Peter said to him, &ldquo;I have neither, but what I have I will certainly give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-3-7-Acts-3-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7-11&nbsp;</sup>Then he took him by the right hand and helped him up. At once his feet and ankle bones were strengthened, and he positively jumped to his feet, stood, and then walked. Then he went with them into the Temple, where he walked about, leaping and thanking God. Everyone noticed him as he walked and praised God and recognised him as the same beggar who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate, and they were all overcome with wonder and sheer astonishment at what had happened to him. Then while the man himself still clung to Peter and John all the people in their excitement ran together and crowded round them in Solomon&rsquo;s Porch.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-3-12-Acts-3-16" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12-16&nbsp;</sup>When Peter saw this he spoke to the crowd. &ldquo;Men of Israel, why are you so surprised at this, and why are you staring at us as though we had made this man walk through some power or piety of our own? It is the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, who has done this thing to honour his servant Jesus&mdash;the man whom you betrayed and denied in the presence of Pilate, even when he had decided to let him go. But you disowned the holy and righteous one, and begged to be granted instead a man who was a murderer! You killed the prince of life, but God raised him from the dead&mdash;a fact of which we are eye-witnesses. It is the name of this same Jesus, it is faith in that name, which has cured this man whom you see and recognise. Yes, it was faith in Christ which gave this man perfect health and strength in full view of you all.</span></div>
<h3><span class=3D"text Acts-3-17-Acts-3-23" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Peter explains ancient prophecy</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-3-17-Acts-3-23" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">17-23&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Now of course I know, my brothers, that you had no idea what you were doing any more than your leaders had. But God had foretold through all his prophets that his Christ must suffer and this was how his words came true. Now you must repent and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out, that time after time your souls may know the refreshment that comes from the presence of God. Then he will send you Jesus, your long-heralded Christ, although for the time he must remain in Heaven until that universal restoration of which God spoke in ancient times through all his holy prophets. For Moses said, &lsquo;The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever he says to you. And it shall come to pass that every soul who will not hear that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.&rsquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-3-24-Acts-3-25" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">24-25&nbsp;</sup>Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel onwards who have spoken at all have foretold these days. You are the sons of the prophets and heirs of the agreement which God made with our fathers when he said to Abraham, &lsquo;And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&rsquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-3-26" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>It was to you first that God sent his servant after he had raised him up, to bring you great blessing by turning every one of you away from his evil ways.&rdquo;</span></div>
