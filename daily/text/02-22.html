This came after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled from Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who ruled from Ashtaroth in Edrei.

On your way now. Get moving. Head for the Amorite hills, wherever people are living in the Arabah, the mountains, the foothills, the Negev, the seashore&mdash;the Canaanite country and the Lebanon all the way to the big river, the Euphrates. Look, I&rsquo;ve given you this land. Now go in and take it. It&rsquo;s the land&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;promised to give your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their children after them.&rdquo;</span></div>

But how can I carry, all by myself, your troubles and burdens and quarrels? So select some wise, understanding, and seasoned men from your tribes, and I will commission them as your leaders.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-2079" class=3D"text Deut-1-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>You answered me, &ldquo;Good! A good solution.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-2080" class=3D"text Deut-1-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>So I went ahead and took the top men of your tribes, wise and seasoned, and made them your leaders&mdash;leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, officials adequate for each of your tribes.</span></div>

There I told you, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made it to the Amorite hill country that&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, our God, is giving us. Look,&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, your God, has placed this land as a gift before you. Go ahead and take it now.&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, the God-of-Your-Fathers, promised it to you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Don&rsquo;t lose heart.&rdquo;</span></div>

<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-2085" class=3D"text Deut-1-23-Deut-1-25" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">23-25&nbsp;</sup>That seemed like a good idea to me, so I picked twelve men, one from each tribe. They set out, climbing through the hills. They came to the Eshcol Valley and looked it over. They took samples of the produce of the land and brought them back to us, saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good land that&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, our God, is giving us!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-2086" class=3D"text Deut-1-26-Deut-1-28" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">26-28&nbsp;</sup>But then you weren&rsquo;t willing to go up. You rebelled against&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, your God&rsquo;s plain word. You complained in your tents: &ldquo;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;hates us. He hauled us out of Egypt in order to dump us among the Amorites&mdash;a death sentence for sure! How can we go up? We&rsquo;re trapped in a dead end. Our brothers took all the wind out of our sails, telling us, &lsquo;The people are bigger and stronger than we are; their cities are huge, their defenses massive&mdash;we even saw Anakite giants there!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-2087" class=3D"text Deut-1-29-Deut-1-33" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">29-33&nbsp;</sup>I tried to relieve your fears: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be terrified of them.&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, your God, is leading the way; he&rsquo;s fighting for you. You saw with your own eyes what he did for you in Egypt; you saw what he did in the wilderness, how&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, your God, carried you as a father carries his child, carried you the whole way until you arrived here. But now that you&rsquo;re here, you won&rsquo;t trust&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, your God&mdash;this same&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;who goes ahead of you in your travels to scout out a place to pitch camp, a fire by night and a cloud by day to show you the way to go.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-2088" class=3D"text Deut-1-34-Deut-1-36" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">34-36&nbsp;</sup>When&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;heard what you said, he exploded in anger. He swore, &ldquo;Not a single person of this evil generation is going to get so much as a look at the good land that I promised to give to your parents. Not one&mdash;except for Caleb son of Jephunneh. He&rsquo;ll see it. I&rsquo;ll give him and his descendants the land he walked on because he was all for following&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, heart and soul.&rdquo;</span></div>

Because of you&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&rsquo;s anger spilled over onto me. He said, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t getting in either. Your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will go in. Build up his courage. He&rsquo;s the one who will claim the inheritance for Israel. And your babies of whom you said, &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll be grabbed for plunder,&rsquo; and all these little kids who right now don&rsquo;t even know right from wrong&mdash;they&rsquo;ll get in. I&rsquo;ll give it to them. Yes, they&rsquo;ll be the new owners. But not you. Turn around and head back into the wilderness following the route to the Red Sea.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-2090" class=3D"text Deut-1-41" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>You spoke up, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve sinned against&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>. We&rsquo;ll go up and fight, following all the orders that&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, our God, has commanded.&rdquo; You took your weapons and dressed for battle&mdash;you thought it would be so easy going into those hills!</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-2091" class=3D"text Deut-1-42" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>But&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;told me, &ldquo;Tell them, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do it; don&rsquo;t go up to fight&mdash;I&rsquo;m not with you in this. Your enemies will waste you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-2092" class=3D"text Deut-1-43-Deut-1-46" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">43-46&nbsp;</sup>I told you but you wouldn&rsquo;t listen. You rebelled at the plain word of&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>. You threw out your chests and strutted into the hills. And those Amorites, who had lived in those hills all their lives, swarmed all over you like a hive of bees, chasing you from Seir all the way to Hormah, a stinging defeat. You came back and wept in the presence of&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, but he didn&rsquo;t pay a bit of attention to you;&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t give you the time of day. You stayed there in Kadesh a long time, about as long as you had stayed there earlier.</span></div>

Command the people, You&rsquo;re about to cut through the land belonging to your relatives, the People of Esau who settled in Seir. They are terrified of you, but restrain yourselves. Don&rsquo;t try and start a fight. I am not giving you so much as a square inch of their land. I&rsquo;ve already given all the hill country of Seir to Esau&mdash;he owns it all. Pay them up front for any food or water you get from them.&rdquo;</span></div>

<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-2096" class=3D"text Deut-2-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>So we detoured around our brothers, the People of Esau who live in Seir, avoiding the Arabah Road that comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber; instead we used the road through the Wilderness of Moab.</span></div>
<div class=3D"top-1"><span id=3D"en-MSG-2097" class=3D"text Deut-2-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup><span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;told me, &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t try to pick a fight with the Moabites.

Along with the Anakites they were lumped in with the Rephaites (Ghosts) but in Moab they were called Emites. Horites also used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau took over and destroyed them, the same as Israel did in the land&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;gave them to possess.</span></div>

That&rsquo;s how long it took for the entire generation of soldiers from the camp to die off, as&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;had sworn they would.&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;was relentless against them until the last one was gone from the camp.</span></div>

When you approach the People of Ammon, don&rsquo;t try and pick a fight with them because I&rsquo;m not giving you any of the land of the People of Ammon for yourselves&mdash;I&rsquo;ve already given it to the People of Lot.&rdquo; It is also considered to have once been the land of the Rephaites. Rephaites lived there long ago&mdash;the Ammonites called them Zamzummites (Barbarians)&mdash;huge mobs of them, giants like the Anakites.&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;destroyed them and the Ammonites moved in and took over. It was the same with the People of Esau who live in Seir&mdash;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;got rid of the Horites who lived there earlier and they moved in and took over, as you can see. Regarding the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites who came from Caphtor (Crete) wiped them out and moved in.</span></div>
