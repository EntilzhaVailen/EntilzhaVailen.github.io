I saw the tears of the people who were suffering under these powers, with no one to comfort them. Those who made it hard for them had the power. But the people had no one to comfort them.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17384" class=3D"text Eccl-4-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>So I thought that those who are already dead are better off than those who are still living.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17385" class=3D"text Eccl-4-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>But better than both is the one who has never been, who has never seen the wrong that is done under the sun.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-17386" class=3D"text Eccl-4-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>I have seen that all the work done is because a man wants what his neighbor has. This also is for nothing, like trying to catch the wind.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17387" class=3D"text Eccl-4-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>The fool folds his hands and has no food to eat.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17388" class=3D"text Eccl-4-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>One hand full of rest is better than two hands full of work and trying to catch the wind.</span></span></div>

He did not have a son or a brother. Yet he worked all the time. His eyes were never happy with the riches he had, and he never asked, &ldquo;For whom am I working and why am I keeping myself from happiness?&rdquo; This also is for nothing. It is work that brings sorrow.</span></span></div>

But how can one be warm alone?&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17394" class=3D"text Eccl-4-12"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>One man is able to have power over him who is alone, but two can stand against him. It is not easy to break a rope made of three strings.</span></span></div>

<h3><span id=3D"en-NLV-17399" class=3D"text Eccl-5-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Do What You Promise</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Eccl-5-1"><span class=3D"chapternum">5&nbsp;</span>Watch your steps as you go to the house of God. Go near and listen but do not give the gift of fools. For they do not know they are sinning.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17400" class=3D"text Eccl-5-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Do not hurry to speak or be in a hurry as you think what to tell God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth. So let your words be few.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17401" class=3D"text Eccl-5-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>For a dream comes with much work, and the voice of a fool comes with many words.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17402" class=3D"text Eccl-5-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>When you make a promise to God, do not be late in paying it, for He is not pleased with fools. Pay what you promise to pay!&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17403" class=3D"text Eccl-5-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>It is better not to make a promise, than to make a promise and not pay it.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17404" class=3D"text Eccl-5-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Do not let your mouth cause you to sin. And do not say to the one sent from God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry because of what you said, and destroy the work of your hands?&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17405" class=3D"text Eccl-5-7"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>For when there are many dreams, there are many empty words. Instead of this, honor God with fear.</span></span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-NLV-17406" class=3D"text Eccl-5-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Money and Honor Are of Little Worth</span></h3>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Eccl-5-8"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>In one part of a land if you see a bad power held over the poor, and what is right and fair and good taken away, do not be surprised by what you see. For one leader watches over another leader, and more important leaders watch over them.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17407" class=3D"text Eccl-5-9"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>After all, a country does better with a king in power.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-17408" class=3D"text Eccl-5-10"><sup class=3D"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>He who loves money will never have enough money to make him happy. It is the same for the one who loves to get many things. This also is for nothing.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17409" class=3D"text Eccl-5-11"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>When there are more good things, there are also more people to eat them. So what does their owner get except to see them with his eyes?&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17410" class=3D"text Eccl-5-12"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>The sleep of the working man is pleasing, if he eats little or much. But the full stomach of the rich man does not let him sleep.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-17411" class=3D"text Eccl-5-13"><sup class=3D"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>There is something very wrong which I have seen under the sun: Riches being kept by the owner and he is hurt by them.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17412" class=3D"text Eccl-5-14"><sup class=3D"versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>When those riches are lost because he used them in a wrong way, and he had become the father of a son, there was nothing left for him.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17413" class=3D"text Eccl-5-15"><sup class=3D"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>A man comes from his mother without clothing, and he will go as he came. He will take nothing from his work that he can carry in his hand.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17414" class=3D"text Eccl-5-16"><sup class=3D"versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>This also is very wrong: As a man is born, this is the way he will leave. So what does the man get who works for the wind?&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17415" class=3D"text Eccl-5-17"><sup class=3D"versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>All his life he eats in darkness with much sorrow, sickness and anger.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-17416" class=3D"text Eccl-5-18"><sup class=3D"versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>This is what I have seen to be good and right: to eat and to drink and be happy in all the work one does under the sun during the few years of his life which God has given him. For this is his reward.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17417" class=3D"text Eccl-5-19"><sup class=3D"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>As for every man to whom God has given riches and many good things, He has also given him the power to eat from them, receive his reward and be happy in his work. This is the gift of God.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17418" class=3D"text Eccl-5-20"><sup class=3D"versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>For he will not think much about the years of his life, because God keeps him happy in his heart.</span></span></div>
<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-17419" class=3D"text Eccl-6-1"><span class=3D"chapternum">6&nbsp;</span>There is another bad thing which I have seen under the sun, and it is hard for men:&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17420" class=3D"text Eccl-6-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>God gives a man riches and many good things and honor, so that he has everything he wants. But He does not allow him to have joy from them, for a stranger has joy from them. This is for nothing, and is very bad.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17421" class=3D"text Eccl-6-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>If a man becomes the father of a hundred children and lives many years until he is very old, but he is not happy with good things, and is not buried as he should be, then I say that the child who dies before it is born is shown more favor than he.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17422" class=3D"text Eccl-6-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>For this child comes for nothing and goes into darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17423" class=3D"text Eccl-6-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>It never sees the sun and it never knows anything. It is better off than he.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17424" class=3D"text Eccl-6-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Even if the other man lives a thousand years twice and does not find joy in good things, do not all go to the same place?</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-17425" class=3D"text Eccl-6-7"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>All a man&rsquo;s work is for his mouth, and yet his hunger is not filled.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17426" class=3D"text Eccl-6-8"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>For what is better for the wise man than for the fool? And what good does the poor man have who knows how to walk among the living?&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17427" class=3D"text Eccl-6-9"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>What the eyes see is better than what there is a desire for. This also is for nothing, like trying to catch the wind.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-17428" class=3D"text Eccl-6-10"><sup class=3D"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Whatever has come to be has already been given a name. It is known what man is, and that he cannot argue with one who is stronger than he.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17429" class=3D"text Eccl-6-11"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>The more words there are, the more they are worth nothing. What good is that to anyone?&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-17430" class=3D"text Eccl-6-12"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>For who knows what is good for a man during his life, during the few years of his living for nothing? He will spend them like a shadow. For who can tell a man what will happen after he is gone under the sun?</span></span></div>
