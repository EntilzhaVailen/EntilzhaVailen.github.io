<h3><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4182" class=3D"text Acts-12-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Herod kills James</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Acts-12-1"><span class=3D"chapternum">12&nbsp;</span>Around that time, King Herod began to use violence towards some members of the church.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4183" class=3D"text Acts-12-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He killed James the brother of John with the sword.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4184" class=3D"text Acts-12-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>When he saw that it pleased the Judaeans, he proceeded to arrest Peter, too. (This was around the time of the Festival of Unleavened Bread.)&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4185" class=3D"text Acts-12-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>So, when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and gave four squads of soldiers the job of guarding him, with the intention of bringing him out to the people after Passover.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4186" class=3D"text Acts-12-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>So Peter was kept in prison. But the church prayed earnestly to God on his behalf.</span></span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4187" class=3D"text Acts-12-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Peter&rsquo;s rescue and Rhoda&rsquo;s mistake</span></h3>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Acts-12-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>On the night when Herod was intending to bring Peter out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. There were guards on the doors, watching the prison.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4188" class=3D"text Acts-12-7"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood there, and a light shone in the cell.</span></span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-12-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The angel hit Peter on the side and woke him up.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-12-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">&ldquo;Get up quickly!&rdquo; he said.</span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Acts-12-7">The chains fell off his hands.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4189" class=3D"text Acts-12-8"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Then the angel spoke again.</span></span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-12-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">&ldquo;Get dressed and put on your sandals,&rdquo; he said. So Peter did.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-12-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">&ldquo;Put on your cloak and follow me,&rdquo; said the angel.</span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4190" class=3D"text Acts-12-9"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>So he went out, following the angel. He didn&rsquo;t think all this business with the angel was really happening. He thought he was seeing a vision.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4191" class=3D"text Acts-12-10"><sup class=3D"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>They went through the first set of guards; then the second; and then they came to the iron gate that led into the city. It opened all by itself. They went out and walked along a street. Suddenly the angel left him.</span></span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4192" class=3D"text Acts-12-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter came to his senses.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-12-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">&ldquo;Now I know it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Lord sent his angel and snatched me out of Herod&rsquo;s hands. He rescued me from all the things the Judaeans were intending to do.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4193" class=3D"text Acts-12-12"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Once he had realized this, he went to the house of Mary, John Mark&rsquo;s mother. Lots of people were gathered there, praying.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4194" class=3D"text Acts-12-13"><sup class=3D"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Peter knocked at the door in the outer gate, and a maid called Rhoda came to answer it.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4195" class=3D"text Acts-12-14"><sup class=3D"versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>When she heard Peter&rsquo;s voice, she was so excited that she didn&rsquo;t open the gate. Instead, she ran back in and told them that Peter was standing outside the gate.</span></span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4196" class=3D"text Acts-12-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad!&rdquo; they said to her. But she insisted that it really was true.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-12-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">&ldquo;It must be his angel!&rdquo; they said.</span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4197" class=3D"text Acts-12-16"><sup class=3D"versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile Peter carried on knocking. They opened the door and saw him, and were astonished.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4198" class=3D"text Acts-12-17"><sup class=3D"versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>He made a sign with his hand for them to be quiet. Then he told them how the Lord had led him out of the prison.</span></span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-12-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">&ldquo;Tell this to James, and to the other brothers and sisters,&rdquo; he said.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Acts-12-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Then he left, and went somewhere else.</span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4199" class=3D"text Acts-12-18"><sup class=3D"versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>When morning came, there was quite a commotion among the guards as to what had become of Peter.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4200" class=3D"text Acts-12-19"><sup class=3D"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Herod looked for him but couldn&rsquo;t find him. He interrogated the guards and ordered them to be put to death. Then he left Judaea and went down to Caesarea, and stayed there.</span></span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4201" class=3D"text Acts-12-20" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Herod&rsquo;s vanity and death</span></h3>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Acts-12-20"><sup class=3D"versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They all came together to meet him, and they persuaded Blastus, who was in charge of the king&rsquo;s bedchamber, to seek a reconciliation. (They were, you see, dependent on the king&rsquo;s country for their food.)&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4202" class=3D"text Acts-12-21"><sup class=3D"versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>So a day was set, and Herod dressed himself in his royal robes and took his seat on the official platform to make a public address to them.</span></span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4203" class=3D"text Acts-12-22" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>The people began to shout, &ldquo;The voice of a god, not of a mortal!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4204" class=3D"text Acts-12-23" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he didn&rsquo;t give God the glory. He was eaten by worms and expired.</span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4205" class=3D"text Acts-12-24"><sup class=3D"versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>But God&rsquo;s word grew and multiplied.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NTFE-4206" class=3D"text Acts-12-25"><sup class=3D"versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Barnabas and Saul had by now accomplished their ministry in Jerusalem, and they came back to Antioch, bringing John Mark with them.</span></span></div>
