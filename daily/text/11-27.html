<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Eph-2-1"><span class=3D"chapternum">2&nbsp;</span>At one time you were dead because of your sins.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-29232" class=3D"text Eph-2-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>You followed the sinful ways of the world and obeyed the leader of the power of darkness. He is the devil who is now working in the people who do not obey God.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-29233" class=3D"text Eph-2-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>At one time all of us lived to please our old selves. We gave in to what our bodies and minds wanted. We were sinful from birth like all other people and would suffer from the anger of God.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-29234" class=3D"text Eph-2-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>But God had so much loving-kindness.
