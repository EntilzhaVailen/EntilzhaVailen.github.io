I saw a wild animal come up out of the sea. The beast had seven heads and ten horns. On its horns were ten big crowns. On its heads it had names that did not respect God.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7664" class=3D"text Rev-13-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The beast I saw was like a leopard. It had feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion. The dragon gave it his own strength, his own throne, and great power.</span></div>

<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7666" class=3D"text Rev-13-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>They worshipped the dragon because he had given this power to the beast. And they worshipped the beast too. They said, `Who is like this beast? Who can fight against it?'</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7667" class=3D"text Rev-13-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>The beast was given a mouth that spoke proud words against God. It was given power to rule for forty-two months.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7668" class=3D"text Rev-13-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>It opened its mouth to speak against God, to speak against his name and the place where he lives, and to speak against those who live in heaven.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7669" class=3D"text Rev-13-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>It was also given power to fight against God's people and to win the fight against them. It was given power to rule over every tribe, nation, language, and country.</span></div>

<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7683" class=3D"text Rev-14-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>They were singing a new song in front of God's chief chair, in front of the four living beings and the leaders. No one could learn that song but the one hundred and forty-four thousand people. They have been bought from the earth.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7684" class=3D"text Rev-14-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>They are the people who have not had sex with women. They are clean. They are the people who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They lived among people on earth. They have been bought from the earth.

<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7689" class=3D"text Rev-14-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup>A third angel followed the other two. He said in a loud voice, `Any person who worships the beast or its idol, and takes its mark on his forehead or on his hand, will also feel God's anger. He is very angry. That person will be burned with fire and dust that chokes people when it burns. He will be burned in front of the holy angels and the Lamb.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7690" class=3D"text Rev-14-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>The smoke of that fire goes up for ever and ever. Those who worship the animal and its idol, and anyone who takes the mark of its name, will get no rest day or night.'</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7691" class=3D"text Rev-14-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>This is why God's people must be patient. They are the ones who keep the laws of God and believe in Jesus.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-WE-7692" class=3D"text Rev-14-13" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>I heard a voice from the sky.
