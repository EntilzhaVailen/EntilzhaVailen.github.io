<li id=3D"fen-NCB-26130a"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Daniel 5:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">If there was a historical Belshazzar, he was the son of Nabonidus, not of Nebuchadnezzar; in any case, he was not given an opportunity to ascend the throne, but simply substituted for his father until Babylon fell in 539 B.C. under the blows of Cyrus the Persian, who had first subdued the Medes. The text speaks of Darius the Mede (6:1), but the only Dariuses known to history were all Persians. It is not a matter of concern that the author mixes up overly vague historical memories. His purpose is a different one: to denounce once more the human pride that claims the right to laugh at God. On the figure of Belshazzar are imposed the characteristics of Antiochus IV, who sacked temples, profaned things holy, and had himself worshiped as a god, while haughtily controlling the destiny of human beings (see&nbsp;1&nbsp;Mac 1:16-64;&nbsp;6:1-5;&nbsp;2&nbsp;Mac 3:1-40;&nbsp;5:11-20;&nbsp;9:2).</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-26154b"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Daniel 5:25&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">The words of the inscription are names of weights or monies, allowing the play on words in the interpretation.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-26160c"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Daniel 6:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">The Babylonian kings are followed by a Persian monarch. Because he has been advanced to high offices in the empire, Daniel has aroused the jealousy of other officials. His manner of praying becomes the basis for an accusation, and he is condemned. But the trust and fidelity of the righteous will be rewarded: Daniel will be saved. Moreover&mdash;and this is the apologetic purpose of the story&mdash;the astonished king will make a public profession of faith in&nbsp;<em>the living God</em>&nbsp;who&nbsp;<em>delivers, rescues</em>, and will, himself, proclaim the unending reign of God (vv.&nbsp;27-28).</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-26161d"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Daniel 6:2&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">The division of the empire into satraps was effected by Darius I of Persia in 521 B.C.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-26170e"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Daniel 6:11&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">The verse tells us how a fervent Jew prayed:&nbsp;<em>three times a day</em>, facing&nbsp;<em>toward Jerusalem.</em></span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-26189f"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Daniel 7:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Up to this point we have been edified by events in the life of a hero. Now he, himself, speaks in the chiaroscuro language of the apocalypses. The narrative transports the reader beyond the passing scene: the great empires that come and are swallowed up are simply preparations for the events that will mark the end of time. The prophet will also proclaim the mysterious coming of a &ldquo;son of man&rdquo; and the resurrection of the righteous.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-26189g"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Daniel 7:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">This is the most important eschatological passage in the Book of Daniel. The immediate explanation is concerned with the time of Antiochus IV. But there are other Antiochuses in the course of human history.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-26189h"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Daniel 7:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">These fabulous animals, close relatives of the forces of disorder which are often mentioned in the Bible (Ps 74;&nbsp;Isa 51:9) or in the primitive traditions of the peoples, stand here for the empires that controlled the East from the seventh to the second century before our era. If we may judge by the images he uses, the author sees the order of regimes as follows: Babylon, the Medes, the Persians, and then the Greeks, who have recently astonished the world by the conquests of Alexander the Great, who died in 323 B.C. Alexander&rsquo;s successors have divided his empire among themselves, and it is this that is presently sowing terror. Horns are always a sign of power; here they symbolize the kings of the Greek dynasty of the Seleucids, who control Syria. The little, destructive horn is Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175&ndash;163 B.C.), who has rid himself of more than one of his rivals. This entire scenario, then, is intended to fill out the portrait of this persecuting ruler. But Antiochus IV has passed away, and other haughty regimes have arisen that must be identified with the same critical clarity. The Book of Revelation (Rev 13) takes over the image of the horned beast to signify evil in all the forms in which it is directed against the community of those whom Christ has brought together.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NCB-26197i"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Daniel 7:9&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">At this point, a mysterious personage is enthroned: the Man par excellence, who calls to mind the figure of the Servant in Isaiah (Isa 52:13-15) and represents the group of spiritual believers to whom God entrusts his kingdom forever (Dan 7:18,&nbsp;22,&nbsp;27). He stands at the head of the kingdom of God announced by the Prophets. In this way the coming fall of Antiochus and of the persecuting regimes is prefigured; it will be possible once again to profess the faith freely. In addition, the vision promises a new era in which the whole of humanity will be gathered into the one kingdom of God. Also included here is the title&nbsp;<em>son of man</em>, which Jesus will apply to himself and which, once freed from nationalistic interpretations, will suggest the newness of God&rsquo;s work in the world, namely, the gospel message. In the Christian Apocalypse, the title designates Christ as judge at the end of time (Mt 24:30;&nbsp;Rev 1:13;&nbsp;14:14).</span></span></li>
