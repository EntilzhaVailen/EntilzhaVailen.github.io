I&rsquo;m innocent! From now on I&rsquo;ll go to the Gentiles!&rdquo;</span>&nbsp;<span id=3D"en-CEB-27551" class=3D"text Acts-18-7"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>He left the synagogue and went next door to the home of Titius Justus, a Gentile God-worshipper.</span>&nbsp;<span id=3D"en-CEB-27552" class=3D"text Acts-18-8"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household came to believe in the Lord.

<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Acts-18-24"><sup class=3D"versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile, a certain Jew named Apollos arrived in Ephesus.

He taught accurately the things about Jesus, even though he was aware only of the baptism John proclaimed and practiced.</span>&nbsp;<span id=3D"en-CEB-27570" class=3D"text Acts-18-26"><sup class=3D"versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>He began speaking with confidence in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they received him into their circle of friends and explained to him God&rsquo;s way more accurately.</span>&nbsp;<span id=3D"en-CEB-27571" class=3D"text Acts-18-27"><sup class=3D"versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>When he wanted to travel to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples so they would open their homes to him.

<div><span class=3D"text Acts-19-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">They replied, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-CEB-27575" class=3D"text Acts-19-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then he said, &ldquo;What baptism did you receive, then?&rdquo;</span></div>
