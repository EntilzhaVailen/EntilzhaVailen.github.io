<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1437" class=3D"text John-18-1-John-18-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus is arrested in the garden</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span class=3D"text John-18-1-John-18-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">18&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-2&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the Cedron valley to a place where there was a garden, and they went into it together. Judas who betrayed him knew the place, for Jesus often met his disciples there.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1438" class=3D"text John-18-3-John-18-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">3-4&nbsp;</sup>So Judas fetched the guard and the officers which the chief priests and Pharisees had provided for him, and came to the place with torches and lanterns and weapons. Jesus, fully realising all that was going to happen to him, went forward and said to them, &ldquo;Who are you looking for?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1439" class=3D"text John-18-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth,&rdquo; they answered. &ldquo;I am the man,&rdquo; said Jesus. (Judas who was betraying him was standing there with the others.)</span></div>

So Jesus asked them again, &ldquo;Who are you looking for?&rdquo; And again they said, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1441" class=3D"text John-18-8-John-18-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">8-9&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have told you that I am the man,&rdquo; replied Jesus. &ldquo;If I am the man you are looking for, let these others go.&rdquo; (Thus fulfilling his previous words, &ldquo;I have not lost one of those whom you gave me.&rdquo;)</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1442" class=3D"text John-18-10-John-18-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">10-11&nbsp;</sup>At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and slashed at the High Priest&rsquo;s servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant&rsquo;s name was Malchus.) But Jesus said to Peter, &ldquo;Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup the Father has given me?&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1443" class=3D"text John-18-12-John-18-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Peter follows Jesus, only to deny him</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text John-18-12-John-18-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12-17&nbsp;</sup>Then the guard, with their captain and the Jewish officers, took hold of Jesus and tied his hands together, and led him off to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was High Priest that year. Caiaphas was the man who advised the Jews, &ldquo;that it would be a good thing that one man should die for the sake of the people.&rdquo; Behind Jesus followed Simon Peter, and one other disciple who was known personally to the High Priest. He went in with Jesus into the High Priest&rsquo;s courtyard, but Peter was left standing at the door outside. So this other disciple, who was acquainted with the High Priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter inside. The young woman at the door remarked to Peter, &ldquo;Are you one of this man&rsquo;s disciples, too?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; retorted Peter.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1444" class=3D"text John-18-18" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>In the courtyard, the servants and officers stood around a charcoal fire which they had made, for it was cold. They were warming themselves, and Peter stood there with them, keeping himself warm.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1445" class=3D"text John-18-19" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile the High Priest interrogated Jesus about his disciples and about his own teaching.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1446" class=3D"text John-18-20-John-18-21" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">20-21&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have always spoken quite openly to the world,&rdquo; replied Jesus. &ldquo;I have always taught in the synagogue or in the Temple where all the Jews meet together, and I have said nothing in secret. Why do you question me? Why not question those who have heard me about what I said to them? Obviously they are the ones who know what I actually said.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1447" class=3D"text John-18-22" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>As he said this, one of those present, an officer, slapped Jesus with his open hand, remarking, &ldquo;Is that the way for you to answer the High Priest?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1448" class=3D"text John-18-23" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If I have said anything wrong,&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;you must give evidence about it, but if what I said was true, why do you strike me?</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1449" class=3D"text John-18-24" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Then Annas sent him, with his hands still tied, to the High Priest Caiaphas.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1450" class=3D"text John-18-25" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Peter&rsquo;s denial</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text John-18-25" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>In the meantime Simon Peter was still standing, keeping himself warm. Some of them said to him, &ldquo;Surely you too are one of his disciples, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; And he denied it and said, &ldquo;No, I am not.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1451" class=3D"text John-18-26" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Then one of the High Priest&rsquo;s servants, a relation of the man (Malchus) whose ear Peter had cut off, remarked, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see you in the garden with him?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1452" class=3D"text John-18-27" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>And again Peter denied it. And immediately the cock crew.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1453" class=3D"text John-18-28" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus is taken before the Roman authority</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text John-18-28" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas&rsquo; presence into the palace. It was now early morning and the Jews themselves did not go into the palace, for fear that they would be contaminated and would not be able to eat the Passover.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1454" class=3D"text John-18-29" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>So Pilate walked out to them and said, &ldquo;What is the charge that you are bringing against this man?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1455" class=3D"text John-18-30" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If he were not an evil-doer, we should not have handed him over to you,&rdquo; they replied.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1456" class=3D"text John-18-31-John-18-32" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">31-32&nbsp;</sup>To which Pilate retorted, &ldquo;Then take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are not allowed to put a man to death,&rdquo; replied the Jews (thus fulfilling Christ&rsquo;s prophecy of the method of his own death).</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1457" class=3D"text John-18-33" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>So Pilate went back into the Palace and called Jesus to him. &ldquo;Are you the king of the Jews?&rdquo; he asked.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1458" class=3D"text John-18-34" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Are you asking this of your own accord,&rdquo; replied Jesus, &ldquo;or have other people spoken to you about me?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1459" class=3D"text John-18-35" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Do you think I am a Jew?&rdquo; replied Pilate. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What have you done, anyway?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1460" class=3D"text John-18-36" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;My kingdom is not founded in this world&mdash;if it were, my servants would have fought to prevent my being handed over to the Jews. But in fact my kingdom is not founded on all this!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1461" class=3D"text John-18-37" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;So you are a king, are you?&rdquo; returned Pilate. &ldquo;Indeed I am a king,&rdquo; Jesus replied; &ldquo;the reason for my birth and the reason for my coming into the world is to witness to the truth. Every man who loves truth recognises my voice.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1462" class=3D"text John-18-38-John-18-39" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">38-39&nbsp;</sup>To which Pilate retorted, &ldquo;What is &lsquo;truth&rsquo;?&rdquo; and went straight out again to the Jews and said: &ldquo;I find nothing criminal about him at all. But I have an arrangement with you to set one prisoner free at Passover time. Do you wish me then to set free for you the &lsquo;king of the Jews&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1463" class=3D"text John-18-40" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>At this, they shouted out again, &ldquo;No, not this man, but Barabbas!&rdquo; Barabbas was a bandit.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1464" class=3D"text John-19-1-John-19-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Pilate&rsquo;s vain efforts to save Jesus</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span class=3D"text John-19-1-John-19-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">19&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-3&nbsp;</sup>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged, and the soldiers twisted thorn-twigs into a crown and put it on his head, threw a purple robe around him and kept coming into his presence, saying, &ldquo;Hail, king of the Jews!&rdquo; And then they slapped him with their open hands.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1465" class=3D"text John-19-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Then Pilate went outside again and said to them, &ldquo;Look, I bring him out before you here, to show that I find nothing criminal about him at all.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1466" class=3D"text John-19-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>And at this Jesus came outside too, wearing the thorn crown and the purple robe. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Pilate, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the man!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1467" class=3D"text John-19-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>The sight of him made the chief priests and Jewish officials shout at the top of their voices, &ldquo;Crucify! Crucify!&rdquo; &ldquo;You take him and crucify him,&rdquo; retorted Pilate. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no criminal as far as I can see!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1468" class=3D"text John-19-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>The Jews answered him, &ldquo;We have a Law, and according to that Law, he must die, for he made himself out to be Son of God!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1469" class=3D"text John-19-8-John-19-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">8-9&nbsp;</sup>When Pilate heard them say this, he became much more uneasy, and returned to the palace again and spoke to Jesus, &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1470" class=3D"text John-19-10" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>But Jesus gave him no reply. So Pilate said to him, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you speak to me? Don&rsquo;t you realise that I have the power to set you free, and I have the power to have you crucified?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1471" class=3D"text John-19-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You have no power at all against me,&rdquo; replied Jesus, &ldquo;except what was given to you from above. And for that reason the one who handed me over to you is even more guilty than you are.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1472" class=3D"text John-19-12" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>From that moment, Pilate tried hard to set him free but the Jews were shouting, &ldquo;If you set this man free, you are no friend of Caesar! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is anti-Caesar!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1473" class=3D"text John-19-13-John-19-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">13-14&nbsp;</sup>When Pilate heard this, he led Jesus outside and sat down upon the Judgment-seat in the place called the Pavement (in Hebrew, Gabbatha). It was preparation day of the Passover and it was now getting on towards midday. Pilate said to the Jews, &ldquo;Look, here&rsquo;s your king!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1474" class=3D"text John-19-15-John-19-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15a&nbsp;</sup>At which they yelled, &ldquo;Take him away, take him away, crucify him!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text John-19-15-John-19-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15b&nbsp;</sup>Am I to crucify your king? Pilate asked them. &ldquo;Caesar is our king and no one else,&rdquo; replied the chief priests.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1475" class=3D"text John-19-16-John-19-21" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">16a&nbsp;</sup>And at this Pilate handed Jesus over to them for crucifixion.</span></div>
<h3><span class=3D"text John-19-16-John-19-21" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The crucifixion</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text John-19-16-John-19-21" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">16b-21&nbsp;</sup>So they took Jesus and he went out carrying the cross himself, to a place called Skull Hill (in Hebrew, Golgotha). There they crucified him, and two others, one on either side of him with Jesus in the middle. Pilate had a placard written out and put on the cross, reading, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. This placard was read by many of the Jews because the place where Jesus was crucified was quite near Jerusalem, and it was written in Hebrew as well as in Latin and Greek. So the chief priests said to Pilate, &ldquo;You should not write &lsquo;The King of the Jews&rsquo;, but &lsquo;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1476" class=3D"text John-19-22" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>To which Pilate retorted, &ldquo;Indeed? What I have written, I have written.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1477" class=3D"text John-19-23-John-19-24" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">23-24&nbsp;</sup>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes between them, taking a quarter-share each. There remained his shirt, which was seamless&mdash;woven in one piece from the top to the bottom. So they said to each other, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us tear it; let&rsquo;s draw lots and see who gets it.&rdquo; This happened to fulfil the scripture which says&mdash;&lsquo;They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots&rsquo;.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1478" class=3D"text John-19-25-John-19-27" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus provides for his mother from the cross</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text John-19-25-John-19-27" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">25-27&nbsp;</sup>While the soldiers were doing this, Jesus&rsquo; mother was standing near the cross with her sister, and with them Mary, the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala. Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by her side, and said to her, &ldquo;Look, there is your son!&rdquo; And then he said to the disciple, &ldquo;And there is your mother!&rdquo; And from that time the disciple took Mary into his own home.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1479" class=3D"text John-19-28" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>After this, Jesus realising that everything was now completed said (fulfilling the saying of scripture), &ldquo;I am thirsty.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1480" class=3D"text John-19-29-John-19-30" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">29-30&nbsp;</sup>There was a bowl of sour wine standing there. So they soaked a sponge in the wine, put it on a spear, and pushed it up towards his mouth. When Jesus had taken it, he cried, &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; His head fell forward, and he died.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1481" class=3D"text John-19-31-John-19-36" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The body of Jesus is removed</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text John-19-31-John-19-36" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">31-36&nbsp;</sup>As it was the day of preparation for the Passover, the Jews wanted to avoid the bodies being left on the crosses over the Sabbath (for that was a particularly important Sabbath), and they requested Pilate to have the men&rsquo;s legs broken and the bodies removed. So the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Jesus. But when they came to him, they saw that he was already dead and they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there was an outrush of blood and water. And the man who saw this is our witness: his evidence is true. (He is certain that he is speaking the truth, so that you may believe as well.) For this happened to fulfil the scripture, &lsquo;Not one of his bones shall be broken.&rsquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1482" class=3D"text John-19-37" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>And again another scripture says&mdash;&lsquo;They shall look on him whom they pierced.&rsquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-1483" class=3D"text John-19-38-John-19-42" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">38-42&nbsp;</sup>After it was all over, Joseph (who came from Arimathaea and was a disciple of Jesus, though secretly for fear of the Jews) requested Pilate that he might take away Jesus&rsquo; body, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took his body down. Nicodemus also, the man who had come to him at the beginning by night, arrived bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. So they took his body and wound it round with linen strips with the spices, according to the Jewish custom of preparing a body for burial. In the place where he was crucified, there was a garden containing a new tomb in which nobody had yet been laid. Because it was the preparation day and because the tomb was conveniently near, they laid Jesus in this tomb.</span></div>
