<h3><span id=3D"en-MSG-8366" class=3D"text Jer-44-1-Jer-44-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The Same Fate Will Fall upon All</span></h3>
<div class=3D"first-line-none chapter-2"><span class=3D"text Jer-44-1-Jer-44-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">44&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-6&nbsp;</sup>The Message that Jeremiah received for all the Judeans who lived in the land of Egypt, who had their homes in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and the land of Pathros: &ldquo;This is what&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies, the God of Israel, says: &lsquo;You saw with your own eyes the terrible doom that I brought down on Jerusalem and the Judean cities. Look at what&rsquo;s left: ghost towns of rubble and smoking ruins, and all because they took up with evil ways, making me angry by going off to offer sacrifices and worship the latest in gods&mdash;no-gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors knew the first thing about. Morning after morning and long into the night I kept after you, sending you all those prophets, my servants, begging you, &ldquo;Please, please&mdash;don&rsquo;t do this, don&rsquo;t fool around in this loathsome gutter of gods that I hate with a passion.&rdquo; But do you think anyone paid the least bit of attention or repented of evil or quit offering sacrifices to the no-gods? Not one. So I let loose with my anger, a firestorm of wrath in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, and left them in ruins and wasted. And they&rsquo;re&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;in ruins and wasted.&rsquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-8367" class=3D"text Jer-44-7-Jer-44-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7-8&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;This is the Message of&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God,</span>&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies, the God of Israel: &lsquo;So why are you ruining your lives by amputating yourselves&mdash;man, woman, child, and baby&mdash;from the life of Judah, leaving yourselves isolated, unconnected? And why do you deliberately make me angry by what you do, offering sacrifices to these no-gods in the land of Egypt where you&rsquo;ve come to live? You&rsquo;ll only destroy yourselves and make yourselves an example used in curses and an object of ridicule among all the nations of the earth.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-8368" class=3D"text Jer-44-9-Jer-44-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9-11&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you so soon forgotten the evil lives of your ancestors, the evil lives of the kings of Judah and their wives, to say nothing of your own evil lives, you and your wives, the evil you flaunted in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? And to this day, there&rsquo;s not a trace of remorse, not a sign of reverence, nobody caring about living by what I tell them or following my instructions that I&rsquo;ve set out so plainly before you and your parents! So this is what&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies decrees:</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Jer-44-9-Jer-44-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">11-14&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;&lsquo;Watch out! I&rsquo;ve decided to bring doom on you and get rid of everyone connected with Judah. I&rsquo;m going to take what&rsquo;s left of Judah, those who have decided to go to Egypt and live there, and finish them off. In Egypt they will either be killed or starve to death. The same fate will fall upon both the obscure and the important. Regardless of their status, they will either be killed or starve. You&rsquo;ll end up cursed, reviled, ridiculed, and mocked. I&rsquo;ll give those who are in Egypt the same medicine I gave those in Jerusalem: massacre, starvation, and disease. None of those who managed to get out of Judah alive and get away to Egypt are going to make it back to the Judah for which they&rsquo;re so homesick. None will make it back, except maybe a few fugitives.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-MSG-8369" class=3D"text Jer-44-15-Jer-44-18" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Making Goddess Cakes</span></h3>
<div class=3D"first-line-none"><span class=3D"text Jer-44-15-Jer-44-18" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15-18&nbsp;</sup>The men who knew that their wives had been burning sacrifices to the no-gods, joined by a large crowd of women, along with virtually everyone living in Pathros of Egypt, answered Jeremiah: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having nothing to do with what you tell us is&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&rsquo;s Message. We&rsquo;re going to go right on offering sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, keeping up the traditions set by our ancestors, our kings and government leaders in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem in the good old days. We had a good life then&mdash;lots of food, rising standard of living, and no bad luck. But the moment we quit sacrificing to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out offerings to her, everything fell apart. We&rsquo;ve had nothing but massacres and starvation ever since.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-8370" class=3D"text Jer-44-19" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>And then the women chimed in: &ldquo;Yes! Absolutely! We&rsquo;re going to keep at it, offering sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out offerings to her. Aren&rsquo;t our husbands behind us? They like it that we make goddess cakes and pour out our offerings to her.&rdquo;</span></div>

He said, &ldquo;The sacrifices that you and your parents, your kings, your government officials, and the common people of the land offered up in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;noticed? He noticed, all right. And he got fed up. Finally, he couldn&rsquo;t take your evil behavior and your disgusting acts any longer. Your land became a wasteland, a death valley, a horror story, a ghost town. And it continues to be just that. This doom has come upon you because you kept offering all those sacrifices, and you sinned against&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>! You refused to listen to him, wouldn&rsquo;t live the way he directed, ignored the covenant conditions.&rdquo;</span></div>

You said it and then you did it. You said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to keep the vows we made to sacrifice to the Queen of Heaven and pour out offerings to her, and nobody&rsquo;s going to stop us!&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Jer-44-24-Jer-44-28" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">25-27&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Well, go ahead. Keep your vows. Do it up big. But also listen to what&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;has to say about it, all you who are from Judah but live in Egypt: &lsquo;I swear by my great name, backed by everything I am&mdash;this is&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;speaking!&mdash;that never again shall my name be used in vows, such as &ldquo;As sure as the Master,&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>, lives!&rdquo; by anyone in the whole country of Egypt. I&rsquo;ve targeted each one of you for doom. The good is gone for good.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Jer-44-24-Jer-44-28" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">27-28&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;&lsquo;All the Judeans in Egypt will die off by massacre or starvation until they&rsquo;re wiped out. The few who get out of Egypt alive and back to Judah will be&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;few, hardly worth counting. Then that ragtag bunch that left Judah to live in Egypt will know who had the last word.</span></div>
