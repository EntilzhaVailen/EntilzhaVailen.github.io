The response to their questions was Jesus&rsquo; eschatological discourse prior to his imminent death. It contained instruction and consolation exhorting the disciples and the church to faith and obedience through the trials that would confront them (Mk 13:5&ndash;13). The sign is the presence of&nbsp;<strong class=3D"catch-word">the desolating abomination</strong>&nbsp;(Mk 13:14; see&nbsp;Dn 9:27), i.e., of the Roman power profaning the temple. Flight from Jerusalem is urged rather than defense of the city through misguided messianic hope (Mk 13:14&ndash;23). Intervention will occur only after destruction (Mk 13:24&ndash;27), which will happen before the end of the first Christian generation (Mk 13:28&ndash;31). No one but the Father knows the precise time, or that of the parousia (Mk 13:32); hence the necessity of constant vigilance (Mk 13:33&ndash;37). Luke sets the parousia at a later date, after &ldquo;the time of the Gentiles&rdquo; (Lk 21:24). See also notes on&nbsp;Mt 24:1&ndash;25:46.</span></span></li>

<li id=3D"fen-NABRE-29075g"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">14:1&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><strong class=3D"catch-word">The Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread</strong>: the connection between the two festivals is reflected in&nbsp;Ex 12:3&ndash;20;&nbsp;34:18;&nbsp;Lv 23:4&ndash;8;&nbsp;Nm 9:2&ndash;14;&nbsp;28:16&ndash;17;&nbsp;Dt 16:1&ndash;8. The Passover commemorated the redemption from slavery and the departure of the Israelites from Egypt by night. It began at sundown after the Passover lamb was sacrificed in the temple in the afternoon of the fourteenth day of the month of Nisan. With the Passover supper on the same evening was associated the eating of unleavened bread. The latter was continued through Nisan 21, a reminder of the affliction of the Israelites and of the haste surrounding their departure. Praise and thanks to God for his goodness in the past were combined at this dual festival with the hope of future salvation.&nbsp;<strong class=3D"catch-word">The chief priests&hellip;to death</strong>: the intent to put Jesus to death was plotted for a long time but delayed for fear of the crowd (Mk 3:6;&nbsp;11:18;&nbsp;12:12).</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NABRE-29076h"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">14:3&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">At Bethany on the Mount of Olives, a few miles from Jerusalem, in&nbsp;<strong class=3D"catch-word">the house of Simon the leper</strong>, Jesus defends a woman&rsquo;s loving action of anointing his head with perfumed oil in view of his impending death and burial as a criminal, in which case his body would not be anointed. See further the note on&nbsp;Jn 12:7. He assures the woman of the remembrance of her deed in the worldwide preaching of the good news.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NABRE-29086i"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">14:12&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><strong class=3D"catch-word">The first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread&hellip;the Passover lamb</strong>: a less precise designation of the day for sacrificing the Passover lamb as evidenced by some rabbinical literature. For a more exact designation, see note on&nbsp;Mk 14:1. It was actually Nisan 14.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NABRE-29087j"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">14:13&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><strong class=3D"catch-word">A man&hellip;carrying a jar of water</strong>: perhaps a prearranged signal, for only women ordinarily carried water in jars. The Greek word used here, however, implies simply a person and not necessarily a male.</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NABRE-29092k"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">14:18&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text"><strong class=3D"catch-word">One of you will betray me, one who is eating with me</strong>: contrasts the intimacy of table fellowship at the Passover meal with the treachery of the traitor; cf.&nbsp;Ps 41:10.</span></span></li>

<li id=3D"fen-NABRE-29096m"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">14:22&ndash;24&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">The actions and words of Jesus express within the framework of the Passover meal and the transition to a new covenant the sacrifice of himself through the offering of his body and blood in anticipation of his passion and death. His&nbsp;<strong class=3D"catch-word">blood of the covenant</strong>&nbsp;both alludes to the ancient rite of&nbsp;Ex 24:4&ndash;8&nbsp;and indicates the new community that the sacrifice of Jesus will bring into being (Mt 26:26&ndash;28;&nbsp;Lk 22:19&ndash;20;&nbsp;1&nbsp;Cor 11:23&ndash;25).</span></span></li>

The sense of both words is vicarious, and it is difficult in Hellenistic Greek to distinguish between them. For&nbsp;<strong class=3D"catch-word">many</strong>&nbsp;in the sense of &ldquo;all,&rdquo; see note on&nbsp;Mt 20:28.</span></span></li>

<li id=3D"fen-NABRE-29100p"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">14:27&ndash;31&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">Jesus predicted that the Twelve would waver in their faith, even abandon him, despite their protestations to the contrary. Yet he reassured them that after his resurrection he would regather them in Galilee (Mk 16:7; cf.&nbsp;Mt 26:32;&nbsp;28:7,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;16;&nbsp;Jn 21), where he first summoned them to be his followers as he began to preach the good news (Mk 1:14&ndash;20).</span></span></li>
<li id=3D"fen-NABRE-29106q"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">14:32&ndash;34&nbsp;<span class=3D"footnote-text">The disciples who had witnessed the raising to life of the daughter of Jairus (Mk 5:37) and the transfiguration of their Master (Mk 9:2) were now invited to witness his degradation and agony and to watch and pray with him.</span></span></li>

The word&nbsp;<strong class=3D"catch-word">&rsquo;abb&#257;&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;seems not to have been used in earlier or contemporaneous Jewish sources to address God without some qualifier. Cf.&nbsp;Rom 8:15;&nbsp;Gal 4:6&nbsp;for other occurrences of the Aramaic word in the Greek New Testament.&nbsp;<strong class=3D"catch-word">Not what I will but what you will</strong>: note the complete obedient surrender of the human will of Jesus to the divine will of the Father; cf.&nbsp;Jn 4:34;&nbsp;8:29;&nbsp;Rom 5:19;&nbsp;Phil 2:8;&nbsp;Hb 5:8.</span></span></li>

Everyone is faced with this struggle, the full force of which Jesus accepted on our behalf and, through his bitter passion and death, achieved the victory.</span></span></li>
