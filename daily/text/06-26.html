They make promises in the name of the Lord, and call upon the God of Israel, but not in truth or by what is right and good.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18617" class=3D"text Isa-48-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>For they call themselves people of the holy city, and trust in the God of Israel. The Lord of All is His name.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18618" class=3D"text Isa-48-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>I made known the things that would happen long ago. From My mouth My words went out. Then all at once I did what I said I would, and they came to pass.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18619" class=3D"text Isa-48-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>I know that your heart is hard. Your neck is like iron, and your forehead is like brass.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18620" class=3D"text Isa-48-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>So I made them known to you long ago. I told you before they happened, or else you might say, &lsquo;My false god has done them. My objects of worship have made them happen.&rsquo;&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18621" class=3D"text Isa-48-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>You have heard, now look at all this. And will you say that you will not tell about it?

You have not known. Even from long ago your ear has not been open, because I knew that you could not be trusted. You have been known to fight against the law and not obey from birth.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18624" class=3D"text Isa-48-9"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Because of My name I hold back My anger.
