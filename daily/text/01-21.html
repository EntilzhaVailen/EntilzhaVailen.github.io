The moment Jacob spotted Rachel, daughter of Laban his mother&rsquo;s brother, saw her arriving with his uncle Laban&rsquo;s sheep, he went and single-handedly rolled the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of his uncle Laban. Then he kissed Rachel and broke into tears. He told Rachel that he was related to her father, that he was Rebekah&rsquo;s son. She ran and told her father. When Laban heard the news&mdash;Jacob, his sister&rsquo;s son!&mdash;he ran out to meet him, embraced and kissed him and brought him home. Jacob told Laban the story of everything that had happened.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-400" class=3D"text Gen-29-14-Gen-29-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">14-15&nbsp;</sup>Laban said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re family! My flesh and blood!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Gen-29-14-Gen-29-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">When Jacob had been with him for a month, Laban said, &ldquo;Just because you&rsquo;re my nephew, you shouldn&rsquo;t work for me for nothing. Tell me what you want to be paid. What&rsquo;s a fair wage?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-401" class=3D"text Gen-29-16-Gen-29-18" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">16-18&nbsp;</sup>Now Laban had two daughters; Leah was the older and Rachel the younger. Leah had nice eyes, but Rachel was stunningly beautiful. And it was Rachel that Jacob loved.</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Gen-29-16-Gen-29-18" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">So Jacob answered, &ldquo;I will work for you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-402" class=3D"text Gen-29-19" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;It is far better,&rdquo; said Laban, &ldquo;that I give her to you than marry her to some outsider. Yes. Stay here with me.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-403" class=3D"text Gen-29-20" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>So Jacob worked seven years for Rachel. But it only seemed like a few days, he loved her so much.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-404" class=3D"text Gen-29-21-Gen-29-24" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">21-24&nbsp;</sup>Then Jacob said to Laban, &ldquo;Give me my wife; I&rsquo;ve completed what we agreed I&rsquo;d do. I&rsquo;m ready to consummate my marriage.&rdquo; Laban invited everyone around and threw a big feast. At evening, though, he got his daughter Leah and brought her to the marriage bed, and Jacob slept with her. (Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maid.)</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-405" class=3D"text Gen-29-25" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Morning came: There was Leah in the marriage bed!</span></div>
<div><span class=3D"text Gen-29-25" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jacob confronted Laban, &ldquo;What have you done to me? Didn&rsquo;t I work all this time for the hand of Rachel? Why did you cheat me?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-406" class=3D"text Gen-29-26-Gen-29-27" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">26-27&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do it that way in our country,&rdquo; said Laban. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t marry off the younger daughter before the older. Enjoy your week of honeymoon, and then we&rsquo;ll give you the other one also. But it will cost you another seven years of work.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-407" class=3D"text Gen-29-28-Gen-29-30" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">28-30&nbsp;</sup>Jacob agreed. When he&rsquo;d completed the honeymoon week, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. (Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid.) Jacob then slept with her. And he loved Rachel more than Leah. He worked for Laban another seven years.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-408" class=3D"text Gen-29-31-Gen-29-32" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">31-32&nbsp;</sup>When&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;realized that Leah was unloved, he opened her womb. But Rachel was barren. Leah became pregnant and had a son. She named him Reuben (Look-It&rsquo;s-a-Boy!). &ldquo;This is a sign,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;has seen my misery; and a sign that now my husband will love me.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-MSG-409" class=3D"text Gen-29-33-Gen-29-35" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">33-35&nbsp;</sup>She became pregnant again and had another son. &ldquo;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>&nbsp;heard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I was unloved and so he gave me this son also.&rdquo; She named this one Simeon (<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>-Heard). She became pregnant yet again&mdash;another son. She said, &ldquo;Now maybe my husband will connect with me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve given him three sons!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why she named him Levi (Connect). She became pregnant a final time and had a fourth son. She said, &ldquo;This time I&rsquo;ll praise&nbsp;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>.&rdquo; So she named him Judah (Praise-<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name">God</span>). Then she stopped having children.</span></div>
