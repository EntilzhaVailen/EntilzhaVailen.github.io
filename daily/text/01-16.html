<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NIRV-365" class=3D"text Gen-15-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Then a message from the <span class=3D"small-caps divine-name" style=3D"font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> came to Abram. The <span class=3D"small-caps divine-name" style=3D"font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> said, &ldquo;When you die, what you have will not go to this man. You will have a son of your own. He will get everything you have.&rdquo; </span> <span id=3D"en-NIRV-366" class=3D"text Gen-15-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>The <span class=3D"small-caps divine-name" style=3D"font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> took Abram outside and said, &ldquo;Look up at the sky. Count the stars, if you can.&rdquo; Then he said to him, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how many children will be born into your family.&rdquo;</span></span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-NIRV-367" class=3D"text Gen-15-6" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Abram believed the <span class=3D"small-caps divine-name" style=3D"font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>. The <span class=3D"small-caps divine-name" style=3D"font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> was pleased with Abram because he believed. So Abram&rsquo;s faith made him right with the <span class=3D"small-caps divine-name" style=3D"font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-NIRV-368" class=3D"text Gen-15-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>He also said to Abram, &ldquo;I am the <span class=3D"small-caps divine-name" style=3D"font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>. I brought you out of Ur in the land of Babylon. I will give you this land to have as your very own.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-NIRV-369" class=3D"text Gen-15-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>But Abram said, &ldquo;<span class=3D"small-caps divine-name" style=3D"font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> and King, how can I know I will have this land as my own?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-NIRV-370" class=3D"text Gen-15-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>So the <span class=3D"small-caps divine-name" style=3D"font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> said to him, &ldquo;Bring me a young cow, a goat and a ram.

For 400 years, your family who comes after you will be strangers in another country.

<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NIRV-378" class=3D"text Gen-15-17"><sup class=3D"versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>The sun set and it became dark.
