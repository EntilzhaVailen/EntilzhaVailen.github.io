He led them into the land that God had promised to give to them. Israel's people lived there, in their own country, for several hundred years. But that country was a picture of the place of rest that God wants to give us. God still has a special place of rest for his people. This is not a place on earth where we can rest. He wants us to rest with him for ever in the place that he has prepared for us. Even during our lives here on earth, God gives us a place of rest with himself. We know he loves us because Christ died on our behalf. There is no work that we need to do to make him love us. We can rest like this if we really believe in Jesus and we know that God has forgiven us.</span></span></li>
