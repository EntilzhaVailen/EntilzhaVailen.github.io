<h3><span id=3D"en-NLV-18698" class=3D"text Isa-52-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">God Saves Israel</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Isa-52-1"><span class=3D"chapternum">52&nbsp;</span>Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion. Put on your beautiful clothes, O Jerusalem, the holy city. For those who have not gone through the religious act of becoming a Jew and those who are unclean will not come into you any more.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18699" class=3D"text Isa-52-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Shake off the dust. Rise up, O Jerusalem, who has been taken into prison. Loose yourself from the chains around your neck, O chained people of Zion who are in prison.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18700" class=3D"text Isa-52-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>For the Lord says, &ldquo;You were sold for nothing, and you will be bought without money and made free.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18701" class=3D"text Isa-52-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>For the Lord God says, &ldquo;My people went down at first to Egypt to live there. Then the Assyrian made it hard for them without a reason.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18702" class=3D"text Isa-52-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>So now what do I have here,&rdquo; says the Lord, &ldquo;Seeing that My people have been taken away for no reason?&rdquo; The Lord says, &ldquo;Those who rule over them call out in a loud voice and My name is spoken against all day long.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18703" class=3D"text Isa-52-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>So My people will know My name. In that day they will know that it is I Who says, &lsquo;Here I am.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-18704" class=3D"text Isa-52-7"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who tells of peace and brings good news of happiness, who tells of saving power, and says to Zion, &ldquo;Your God rules!&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18705" class=3D"text Isa-52-8"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices. They call out together for joy, for they will see with their own eyes the return of the Lord to Zion.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18706" class=3D"text Isa-52-9"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Break out together into singing, you waste places of Jerusalem. For the Lord has comforted His people. He has saved Jerusalem.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18707" class=3D"text Isa-52-10"><sup class=3D"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>The Lord has shown His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, that all the ends of the earth may see that our God saves.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-18708" class=3D"text Isa-52-11"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Leave, leave, go from them. Touch nothing that is unclean. Leave and make yourselves pure, you who carry the holy objects of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18709" class=3D"text Isa-52-12"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>But you will not go out in a hurry. You will not leave as if you were running for your lives. For the Lord will go before you. And the God of Israel will keep watch behind you.</span></span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-NLV-18710" class=3D"text Isa-52-13" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The Suffering Servant</span></h3>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Isa-52-13"><sup class=3D"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>See, My Servant will do well. He will be high and lifted up and honored very much.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18711" class=3D"text Isa-52-14"><sup class=3D"versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Just as many looked in wonder at you, My people, so His face was marked worse than any man, and His body more than the sons of men.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18712" class=3D"text Isa-52-15"><sup class=3D"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>He will surprise many nations. Kings will shut their mouths because of Him. What they had never been told about Him, they will see. And what they had never heard about Him, they will understand.</span></span></div>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-18713" class=3D"text Isa-53-1"><span class=3D"chapternum">53&nbsp;</span>Who has believed what we told them? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been shown?&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18714" class=3D"text Isa-53-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He grew up before Him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground. He has no beautiful body and when we see Him there is no beauty that we should desire Him.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18715" class=3D"text Isa-53-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>He was hated and men would have nothing to do with Him, a man of sorrows and suffering, knowing sadness well. We hid, as it were, our faces from Him. He was hated, and we did not think well of Him.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-18716" class=3D"text Isa-53-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>For sure He took on Himself our troubles and carried our sorrows. Yet we thought of Him as being punished and hurt by God, and made to suffer.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18717" class=3D"text Isa-53-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>But He was hurt for our wrong-doing. He was crushed for our sins. He was punished so we would have peace. He was beaten so we would be healed.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18718" class=3D"text Isa-53-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>All of us like sheep have gone the wrong way. Each of us has turned to his own way. And the Lord has put on Him the sin of us all.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-18719" class=3D"text Isa-53-7"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Men made it very hard for Him and caused Him to suffer, yet He did not open His mouth. He was taken like a lamb to be put to death. A sheep does not make a sound while its wool is cut and He did not open His mouth.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18720" class=3D"text Isa-53-8"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>He was taken away as a prisoner and then judged. Who among the people of that day cared that His life was taken away from the earth? He was hurt because of the sin of the people who should have been punished.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18721" class=3D"text Isa-53-9"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>They gave Him a grave with the sinful, but with the rich at His death, for He had done no wrong, and there was nothing false in His mouth.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-NLV-18722" class=3D"text Isa-53-10"><sup class=3D"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>But it was the will of the Lord to crush Him, causing Him to suffer. Because He gives His life as a gift on the altar for sin, He will see His children. Days will be added to His life, and the will of the Lord will do well in His hand.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18723" class=3D"text Isa-53-11"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>He will see what the suffering of His soul brings, and will be pleased. By what He knows, the One Who is right and good, My Servant, will carry the punishment of many and He will carry their sins.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-NLV-18724" class=3D"text Isa-53-12"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>So I will give Him a share among the great. He will divide the riches with the strong, because He gave up His life. They thought of Him as One Who broke the Law. Yet He Himself carried the sin of many, and prayed for the sinners.</span></span></div>
