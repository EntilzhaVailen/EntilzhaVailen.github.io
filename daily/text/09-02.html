<h3><span id=3D"en-ICB-12598" class=3D"text Esth-1-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Queen Vashti Disobeys the King</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Esth-1-1"><span class=3D"chapternum">1&nbsp;</span>This is what happened during the time of King Xerxes. He was the king who ruled the 127 areas from India to Cush.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12599" class=3D"text Esth-1-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>In those days King Xerxes ruled from his capital city of Susa.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12600" class=3D"text Esth-1-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>In the third year of his rule, he gave a banquet. It was for all his important men and royal officers. The army leaders from the countries of Persia and Media were there. And the important men from all Xerxes&rsquo; empire were there.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12601" class=3D"text Esth-1-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>The banquet lasted 180 days. All during that time King Xerxes was showing off the great wealth of his kingdom. And he was showing his own honor and greatness.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12602" class=3D"text Esth-1-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>When the 180 days were over, the king gave another banquet. It was held in the courtyard of the palace garden for 7 days. It was for everybody in the palace at Susa, from the greatest to the least important.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12603" class=3D"text Esth-1-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>The courtyard had fine white curtains and purple drapes. These were tied to silver rings on marble pillars by white and purple cords. And there were gold and silver couches. These were on a floor set with tiles of white marble, shells and gems.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12604" class=3D"text Esth-1-7"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Wine was served in gold cups of various kinds. And there was plenty of the king&rsquo;s wine because he was very generous.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12605" class=3D"text Esth-1-8"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>The king commanded that each guest be permitted to drink as much as he wished. He had told the wine servers to serve each man what he wanted.</span></span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-ICB-12606" class=3D"text Esth-1-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Queen Vashti also gave a banquet. It was for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.</span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12607" class=3D"text Esth-1-10"><sup class=3D"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>On the seventh day of the banquet, King Xerxes was very happy because he had been drinking much wine. He gave a command to the seven eunuchs who served him. They were Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carcas.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12608" class=3D"text Esth-1-11"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>He commanded them to bring him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown. She was to come to show her beauty to the people and important men. She was very beautiful.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12609" class=3D"text Esth-1-12"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>The eunuchs told Queen Vashti about the king&rsquo;s command. But she refused to come. Then the king became very angry. His anger was like a burning fire.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12610" class=3D"text Esth-1-13"><sup class=3D"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>It was a custom for the king to ask advice from experts about law and order. So King Xerxes spoke with the wise men. They would know the right thing to do.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12611" class=3D"text Esth-1-14"><sup class=3D"versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>The wise men the king usually talked to were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan. They were seven of the important men of Persia and Media. These seven had special privileges to see the king. They had the highest rank in the kingdom.</span></span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-ICB-12612" class=3D"text Esth-1-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>The king asked those men, &ldquo;What does the law say must be done to Queen Vashti? She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes, which the eunuchs took to her.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12613" class=3D"text Esth-1-16"><sup class=3D"versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Then Memucan spoke to the king and the other important men. He said, &ldquo;Queen Vashti has not done wrong to the king alone. She has also done wrong to all the important men and all the people in all the empire of King Xerxes.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12614" class=3D"text Esth-1-17"><sup class=3D"versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>All the wives of the important men of Persia and Media will hear about the queen&rsquo;s actions. Then they will no longer honor their husbands. They will say, &lsquo;King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought to him. But she refused to come.&rsquo;&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12615" class=3D"text Esth-1-18"><sup class=3D"versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Today the wives of the important men of Persia and Media have heard about the queen&rsquo;s actions. And they will speak in the same way to their husbands. And there will be no end to disrespect and anger.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12616" class=3D"text Esth-1-19"><sup class=3D"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;So, our king, if it pleases you, give a royal order. And let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be changed. The law should say Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her place as queen to someone who is better than she is.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12617" class=3D"text Esth-1-20"><sup class=3D"versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>And let the king&rsquo;s order be announced everywhere in his large kingdom. Then all the women will respect their husbands, from the greatest to the least important.&rdquo;</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12618" class=3D"text Esth-1-21"><sup class=3D"versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>The king and his important men were happy with this advice. So King Xerxes did as Memucan suggested.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12619" class=3D"text Esth-1-22"><sup class=3D"versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>He sent letters to all the areas of the kingdom. A letter was sent to each area, written in its own form of writing. And a letter was sent to each group of people, written in their own language. These letters announced that each man was to be the ruler of his own family. Also, each family was to speak the language of the man.</span></span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-ICB-12620" class=3D"text Esth-2-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Esther Is Made Queen</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Esth-2-1"><span class=3D"chapternum">2&nbsp;</span>Later, King Xerxes was not so angry. Then he remembered Vashti and what she had done. And he remembered his order about her.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12621" class=3D"text Esth-2-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Then the king&rsquo;s personal servants had a suggestion. They said, &ldquo;Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12622" class=3D"text Esth-2-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Let the king choose supervisors in every area of his kingdom. Let them bring every beautiful young virgin to the palace at Susa. These women should be taken to the women&rsquo;s quarters and put under the care of Hegai. He is the king&rsquo;s eunuch in charge of the women. And let beauty treatments be given to them.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12623" class=3D"text Esth-2-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Then let the girl who most pleases the king become queen in place of Vashti.&rdquo; The king liked this advice. So he did as they said.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12624" class=3D"text Esth-2-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Now there was a Jewish man in the palace of Susa. His name was Mordecai son of Jair. Jair was the son of Shimei. And Shimei was the son of Kish. Mordecai was from the tribe of Benjamin.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12625" class=3D"text Esth-2-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Mordecai had been taken captive from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. Mordecai was part of the group taken into captivity with Jehoiachin king of Judah.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12626" class=3D"text Esth-2-7"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, who had no father or mother. So Mordecai took care of her. Hadassah was also called Esther, and she had a very pretty figure and face. Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12627" class=3D"text Esth-2-8"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>The king&rsquo;s command and order had been heard. And many girls had been brought to the palace in Susa. They had been put under the care of Hegai. When this happened, Esther was also taken to the king&rsquo;s palace. She was put into the care of Hegai, who was in charge of the women.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12628" class=3D"text Esth-2-9"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Esther pleased Hegai, and he liked her. So Hegai quickly began giving Esther her beauty treatments and special food. He gave her seven servant girls chosen from the king&rsquo;s palace. Then Hegai moved Esther and her seven servant girls to the best part of the women&rsquo;s quarters.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12629" class=3D"text Esth-2-10"><sup class=3D"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Esther did not tell anyone about her family or who her people were. Mordecai had told her not to.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12630" class=3D"text Esth-2-11"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Every day Mordecai walked back and forth near the courtyard. This was where the king&rsquo;s women lived. He wanted to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12631" class=3D"text Esth-2-12"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Before a girl could take her turn with King Xerxes, she had to complete 12 months of beauty treatments. These were ordered for the women. For 6 months she was treated with oil and myrrh. And she spent 6 months with perfumes and cosmetics.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12632" class=3D"text Esth-2-13"><sup class=3D"versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Then she was ready to go to the king. Anything she asked for was given to her. She could take it with her from the women&rsquo;s quarters to the king&rsquo;s palace.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12633" class=3D"text Esth-2-14"><sup class=3D"versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>In the evening she would go to the king&rsquo;s palace. And in the morning she would return to another part of the women&rsquo;s quarters. There she would be placed under the care of a man named Shaashgaz. Shaashgaz was the king&rsquo;s eunuch in charge of the slave women. The girl would not go back to the king again unless he was pleased with her. Then he would call her by name to come back to him.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12634" class=3D"text Esth-2-15"><sup class=3D"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Esther daughter of Abihail, Mordecai&rsquo;s uncle, had been adopted by Mordecai. The time came for Esther to go to the king. She asked for only what Hegai suggested she should take. (Hegai was the king&rsquo;s eunuch who was in charge of the women.) And everyone who saw Esther liked her.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12635" class=3D"text Esth-2-16"><sup class=3D"versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>So Esther was taken to King Xerxes in the royal palace. This happened in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth. It was in Xerxes&rsquo; seventh year as king.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12636" class=3D"text Esth-2-17"><sup class=3D"versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>And the king was pleased with Esther more than with any of the other virgins. And he liked her more than any of the others. So King Xerxes put a royal crown on Esther&rsquo;s head. And he made her queen in place of Vashti.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12637" class=3D"text Esth-2-18"><sup class=3D"versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Then the king gave a great banquet for Esther. He invited all his important men and royal officers. He announced a holiday in all the empire. And he was generous and gave everyone a gift.</span></span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-ICB-12638" class=3D"text Esth-2-19" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Mordecai Discovers an Evil Plan</span></h3>
<div class=3D"first-line-none"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Esth-2-19"><sup class=3D"versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Now Mordecai was sitting at the king&rsquo;s gate.

That is what Mordecai had told her to do. She still obeyed Mordecai just as she had done when he was bringing her up.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12640" class=3D"text Esth-2-21"><sup class=3D"versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Now Bigthana and Teresh were two of the king&rsquo;s officers who guarded the doorway. While Mordecai was sitting at the king&rsquo;s gate, Bigthana and Teresh became angry at the king. And they began to make plans to kill King Xerxes.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12641" class=3D"text Esth-2-22"><sup class=3D"versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>But Mordecai found out about their plans and told Queen Esther.

<h3><span id=3D"en-ICB-12643" class=3D"text Esth-3-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Haman Plans to Destroy the Jews</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Esth-3-1"><span class=3D"chapternum">3&nbsp;</span>After these things happened, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite. He gave Haman a new rank that was higher than all the important men.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12644" class=3D"text Esth-3-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>And all the royal officers at the king&rsquo;s gate would bow down and kneel before Haman. This was what the king had ordered. But Mordecai would not bow down, and he did not kneel.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12645" class=3D"text Esth-3-3"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then the royal officers at the king&rsquo;s gate asked Mordecai, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you obey the king&rsquo;s command?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12646" class=3D"text Esth-3-4"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>And they said this to him every day. When he did not listen to them, they told Haman about it. They wanted to see if Haman would accept Mordecai&rsquo;s behavior because Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12647" class=3D"text Esth-3-5"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Then Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down to him or kneel before him.

And he thought of himself as too important to try to kill only Mordecai. So he looked for a way to destroy all of Mordecai&rsquo;s people, the Jews, in all of Xerxes&rsquo; kingdom.</span></span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-ICB-12649" class=3D"text Esth-3-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>It was in the first month of the twelfth year of King Xerxes&rsquo; rule. That is the month of Nisan. Pur (that is, the lot) was thrown before Haman. The lot was used to choose a day and a month. So the twelfth month, the month of Adar, was chosen.</span></div>

<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12672" class=3D"text Esth-4-15"><sup class=3D"versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Then Esther sent this answer to Mordecai:&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12673" class=3D"text Esth-4-16"><sup class=3D"versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Go and get all the Jews in Susa together.

<div class=3D"chapter-1"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Esth-5-1"><span class=3D"chapternum">5&nbsp;</span>On the third day Esther put on her royal robes. Then she stood in the inner courtyard of the king&rsquo;s palace, facing the king&rsquo;s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the doorway.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12676" class=3D"text Esth-5-2"><sup class=3D"versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard. When he saw her, he was very pleased. He held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther went up to him and touched the end of the scepter.</span></span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-ICB-12677" class=3D"text Esth-5-3" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then the king asked, &ldquo;What is it, Queen Esther? What do you want to ask me? I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-ICB-12678" class=3D"text Esth-5-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Esther answered, &ldquo;My king, if it pleases you, come today with Haman to a banquet. I have prepared it for you.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-ICB-12679" class=3D"text Esth-5-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Then the king said, &ldquo;Bring Haman quickly so we may do what Esther asks.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Esth-5-5">So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared for them.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12680" class=3D"text Esth-5-6"><sup class=3D"versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>As they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, &ldquo;Now, Esther, what are you asking for?

<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span id=3D"en-ICB-12681" class=3D"text Esth-5-7"><sup class=3D"versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Esther answered, &ldquo;This is what I want and ask for.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12682" class=3D"text Esth-5-8"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>My king, I hope you are pleased with me.

<h3><span id=3D"en-ICB-12683" class=3D"text Esth-5-9" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Haman&rsquo;s Plans Against Mordecai</span></h3>
<div class=3D"first-line-none"><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Esth-5-9"><sup class=3D"versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Haman left the king&rsquo;s palace that day happy and content. Then he saw Mordecai at the king&rsquo;s gate. And he saw that Mordecai did not stand up nor did he tremble with fear before him. So Haman became very angry with Mordecai.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12684" class=3D"text Esth-5-10"><sup class=3D"versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>But he controlled his anger and went home.</span></span></div>
<div><span style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"text Esth-5-10">Then Haman called his friends and Zeresh, his wife, together.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12685" class=3D"text Esth-5-11"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>And he told them about how wealthy he was and how many sons he had. He also told them about all the ways the king had honored him. And he told them how the king had placed him higher than his important men and his royal officers.&nbsp;</span><span id=3D"en-ICB-12686" class=3D"text Esth-5-12"><sup class=3D"versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s not all,&rdquo; Haman added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only person Queen Esther invited to come with the king to the banquet she gave.

<div><span id=3D"en-ICB-12688" class=3D"text Esth-5-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Then Haman&rsquo;s wife Zeresh and all his friends said, &ldquo;Have a platform built to hang someone. Build it 75 feet high. And in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go to the banquet with the king and be happy.&rdquo; Haman liked this suggestion. So he ordered the platform to be built.</span></div>
