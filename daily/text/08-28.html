They even hired propagandists to sap their resolve. They kept this up for about fifteen years, throughout the lifetime of Cyrus king of Persia and on into the reign of Darius king of Persia.</span></div>

<div class=3D"left-1"><span class=3D"text Ezra-4-8-Ezra-4-16" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">We are here to inform the king that the Jews who came from you to us have arrived in Jerusalem and have set about rebuilding that rebellious and evil city. They are busy at work finishing the walls and rebuilding the foundations. The king needs to know that once that city is rebuilt and the wall completed they will no longer pay a penny of tribute, tax, or duty. The royal treasury will feel the loss. We&rsquo;re loyal to the king and cannot sit idly by while our king is being insulted&mdash;that&rsquo;s why we are passing this information on. We suggest that you look into the court records of your ancestors; you&rsquo;ll learn from those books that that city is a rebellious city, a thorn in the side to kings and provinces, a historic center of unrest and revolt. That&rsquo;s why the city was wiped out. We are letting the king know that if that city gets rebuilt and its walls restored, you&rsquo;ll end up with nothing in your province beyond the Euphrates.</span></div>

I gave orders to search the records, and sure enough it turns out that this city has revolted against kings time and again&mdash;rebellion is an old story there. I find that they&rsquo;ve had their share of strong kings who have taken over beyond the Euphrates and exacted taxes, tribute, and duty. So do this: Order these men to stop work immediately&mdash;not a lick of rebuilding in that city unless I order it. Act quickly and firmly; they&rsquo;ve done enough damage to kings!</span></div>

He told him, &lsquo;Take these vessels and place them in The Temple of Jerusalem and rebuild The Temple of God on its original site.&rsquo; And Sheshbazzar did it.
