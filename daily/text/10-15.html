<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-357" class=3D"text Matt-26-1-Matt-26-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus announces his coming death</span></h3>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span class=3D"text Matt-26-1-Matt-26-2" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">26&nbsp;</span><sup class=3D"versenum">1-2&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus had finished all this teaching he spoke to his disciples, &ldquo;Do you realise that the Passover will begin in two days&rsquo; time; and the Son of Man is going to be betrayed and crucified?&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-358" class=3D"text Matt-26-3-Matt-26-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">An evil plot&mdash;and an act of love</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Matt-26-3-Matt-26-5" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">3-5&nbsp;</sup>At that very time the chief priests and elders of the people had assembled in the court of Caiaphas, the High Priest, and were discussing together how they might get hold of Jesus by some trick and kill him. But they kept saying, &ldquo;It must not be during the festival or there might be a riot.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-359" class=3D"text Matt-26-6-Matt-26-13" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">6-13&nbsp;</sup>Back in Bethany, while Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came to him with an alabaster flask of most expensive perfume, and poured it on his head as he was at table. The disciples were indignant when they saw this, and said, &ldquo;What is the point of such wicked waste? Couldn&rsquo;t this perfume have been sold for a lot of money which could be given to the poor?&rdquo; Jesus knew what they were saying and spoke to them, &ldquo;Why must you make this woman feel uncomfortable? She has done a beautiful thing for me. You have the poor with you always, but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she was preparing it for burial. I assure you that wherever the Gospel is preached throughout the whole world, this deed of hers will also be recounted, as her memorial to me.&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-360" class=3D"text Matt-26-14-Matt-26-16" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The betrayal is arranged</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Matt-26-14-Matt-26-16" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">14-16&nbsp;</sup>After this, one of the twelve, Judas Iscariot by name, approached the chief priests. &ldquo;What will you give me,&rdquo; he said to them, &ldquo;if I hand him over to you?&rdquo; They settled with him for thirty silver coins, and from then on he looked for a convenient opportunity to betray Jesus.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-361" class=3D"text Matt-26-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The last supper</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Matt-26-17" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>On the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus with the question, &ldquo;Where do you want us to make our preparations for you to eat the Passover?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-362" class=3D"text Matt-26-18-Matt-26-25" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">18-25&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Go into the city,&rdquo; Jesus replied, &ldquo;to a certain man there and say to him, &lsquo;The Master says, &ldquo;My time is near. I am going to keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover. Then late in the evening he took his place at table with the twelve and during the meal he said, &ldquo;I tell you plainly that one of you is going to betray me.&rdquo; They were deeply distressed at this and each began to say to him in turn, &ldquo;Surely, Lord, I am not the one?&rdquo; And his answer was, &ldquo;The man who has dipped his hand into the dish with me is the man who will betray me. It is true that the Son of Man will follow the road foretold by the scriptures, but alas for the man through whom he is betrayed! It would be better for that man if had never been born.&rdquo; And Judas, who actually betrayed him, said, &ldquo;Master, am I the one?&rdquo; &ldquo;As you say!&rdquo; replied Jesus.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-363" class=3D"text Matt-26-26-Matt-26-29" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">26-29&nbsp;</sup>In the middle of the meal Jesus took a loaf and after blessing it he broke it into pieces and gave it to the disciples. &ldquo;Take and eat this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is my body.&rdquo; Then he took a cup and after thanking God, he gave it to them with the words, &ldquo;Drink this, all of you, for it is my blood, the blood of the new agreement shed to set many free from their sins. I tell you I will drink no more wine until I drink it fresh with you in my Father&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-364" class=3D"text Matt-26-30-Matt-26-31" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">30-31&nbsp;</sup>Then they sang a hymn together and went out to the Mount of Olives. There Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Tonight every one of you will lose his faith in me. For the scripture says, &lsquo;I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered&rsquo;.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-365" class=3D"text Matt-26-32" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>But after I have risen I shall go before you into Galilee!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-366" class=3D"text Matt-26-33" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>At this Peter exclaimed, &ldquo;Even if everyone should lose his faith in you, I never will!&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-367" class=3D"text Matt-26-34" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I tell you, Peter,&rdquo; replied Jesus, &ldquo;that tonight, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-368" class=3D"text Matt-26-35" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Even if it means dying with you I will never disown you,&rdquo; said Peter. And all the disciples made the same protest.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-369" class=3D"text Matt-26-36-Matt-26-39" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The prayer in Gethsemane</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Matt-26-36-Matt-26-39" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">36-39&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus came with the disciples to a place called Gethsemane and said to them, &ldquo;Sit down here while I go over there and pray.&rdquo; Then he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be in terrible distress and misery. &ldquo;My heart is nearly breaking,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;stay here and keep watch with me.&rdquo; Then he walked on a little way and fell on his face and prayed, &ldquo;My Father, if it is possible let this cup pass from me&mdash;yet it must not be what I want, but what you want.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-370" class=3D"text Matt-26-40-Matt-26-46" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">40-46&nbsp;</sup>Then he came back to the disciples and found them fast asleep. He spoke to Peter, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you three keep awake with me for a single hour? Watch and pray, all of you, that you may not have to face temptation. Your spirit is willing, but human nature is weak.&rdquo; Then he went away a second time and prayed, &ldquo;My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to pass from me without my drinking it, then your will must be done.&rdquo; And he came and found them asleep again, for they could not keep their eyes open. So he left them and went away again and prayed for the third time using the same words as before. Then he came back to his disciples and spoke to them, &ldquo;Are you still going to sleep and take your ease? In a moment you will see the Son of Man betrayed into the hands of evil men. Wake up, let us be going! Look, here comes my betrayer!&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-371" class=3D"text Matt-26-47-Matt-26-48" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The betrayal</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Matt-26-47-Matt-26-48" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">47-48&nbsp;</sup>And while the words were still on his lips, Judas, one of the twelve appeared with a great crowd armed with swords and staves, sent by the chief priests and Jewish elders. (The traitor himself had given them a sign, &ldquo;The one I kiss will be the man. Get him!&rdquo;)</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-372" class=3D"text Matt-26-49-Matt-26-50" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">49-50&nbsp;</sup>Without any hesitation he walked up to Jesus. &ldquo;Greetings, Master!&rdquo; he cried and kissed him affectionately. &ldquo;Judas, my friend,&rdquo; replied Jesus, &ldquo;why are you here?&rdquo; Then the others came up, seized hold of Jesus and held him.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-373" class=3D"text Matt-26-51-Matt-26-54" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">51-54&nbsp;</sup>Suddenly one of Jesus&rsquo; disciples drew his sword, slashed at the High Priest&rsquo;s servant and cut off his ear. At this Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Put your sword back into its proper place. All those who take the sword die by the sword. Do you imagine that I could not appeal to my Father, and he would at once send more than twelve legions of angels to defend me? But then, how would the scriptures be fulfilled which say that all this must take place?&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-374" class=3D"text Matt-26-55-Matt-26-56" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">55-56&nbsp;</sup>And then Jesus spoke to the crowds around him: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come out with your swords and staves to capture me like a bandit, have you? Day after day I sat teaching in the Temple and you never laid a finger on me. But all this is happening as the prophets said it would.&rdquo; And at this point all the disciples deserted him and made their escape.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-375" class=3D"text Matt-26-57-Matt-26-58" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus before the High Priest</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Matt-26-57-Matt-26-58" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">57-58&nbsp;</sup>The men who had seized Jesus took him off to Caiaphas the High Priest in whose house the scribes and elders were assembled. Peter followed him at a safe distance right up to the High Priest&rsquo;s courtyard. Then he went inside and sat down with the servants and waited to see the end.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-376" class=3D"text Matt-26-59-Matt-26-61" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">59-61&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile the chief priests and the whole council did all they could to find false evidence against Jesus to get him condemned to death. They failed completely. Even after a number of perjurers came forward they still failed. In the end two of these stood up and said, &ldquo;This man said, &lsquo;I can pull down the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-377" class=3D"text Matt-26-62-Matt-26-64" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">62-64&nbsp;</sup>Then the High Priest rose to his feet and addressed Jesus, &ldquo;Have you no answer? What about the evidence of these men against you?&rdquo; But Jesus was silent. Then the High Priest said to him, &ldquo;I command you by the living God, to tell us on your oath if you are Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I am. Yes, and I tell you that in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of Heaven.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-378" class=3D"text Matt-26-65-Matt-26-66" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">65-66&nbsp;</sup>At this the High Priest tore his robes and cried, &ldquo;That was blasphemy! Where is the need for further witnesses? Look, you&rsquo;ve heard the blasphemy&mdash;what&rsquo;s your verdict now?&rdquo; And they replied, &ldquo;he deserves to die.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-379" class=3D"text Matt-26-67-Matt-26-68" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">67-68&nbsp;</sup>Then they spat in his face and knocked him about, and some slapped him, crying, &ldquo;Prophesy, you Christ, who was that who hit you?&rdquo;</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-380" class=3D"text Matt-26-69-Matt-26-75" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Peter disowns his master</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Matt-26-69-Matt-26-75" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">69-75&nbsp;</sup>All this time Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a maidservant came up to him and said, &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you with Jesus, the man from Galilee?&rdquo; But he denied it before them all, saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; Then when he had gone out into the porch, another maid caught sight of him and said to those who were there, &ldquo;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo; And again he denied it with an oath&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the man&rdquo;! A few minutes later those who were standing about came up to Peter and said to him, &ldquo;You certainly are one of them, you know; it&rsquo;s obvious from your accent.&rdquo; At that he began to curse and swear&mdash;&ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t know the man!&rdquo; Immediately the cock crew, and the words of Jesus came back into Peter&rsquo;s mind&mdash;&ldquo;Before the cock crows you will disown me three times.&rdquo; And he went outside and wept bitterly.</span></div>
<div class=3D"chapter-2"><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-381" class=3D"text Matt-27-1" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><span class=3D"chapternum">27&nbsp;</span>When the morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people met in council to decide how they could get Jesus executed. Then they marched him off with his hands tied, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-382" class=3D"text Matt-27-3-Matt-27-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The remorse of Judas</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Matt-27-3-Matt-27-4" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">3-4&nbsp;</sup>Then Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that he was condemned and in his remorse returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders, with the words, &ldquo;I was wrong&mdash;I have betrayed an innocent man to death.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what has that got to do with us?&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your affair.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-383" class=3D"text Matt-27-5-Matt-27-10" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">5-10&nbsp;</sup>And Judas flung down the silver in the Temple and went outside and hanged himself. But the chief priests picked up the money and said, &ldquo;It is not legal to put this into the Temple treasury. It is, after all, blood-money.&rdquo; So, after a further consultation, they purchased with it the Potter&rsquo;s Field to be a burial-ground for foreigners, which is why it is called &ldquo;the Field of Blood&rdquo; to this day. And so the words of Jeremiah the prophet came true: &lsquo;And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of him who was priced, whom they of the children of Israel priced, and gave them for the potter&rsquo;s field, as the Lord directed them&rsquo;.</span></div>
<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-384" class=3D"text Matt-27-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus before Pilate</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Matt-27-11" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile Jesus stood in front of the governor, who asked him, &ldquo;Well, you&mdash;are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; replied Jesus.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-385" class=3D"text Matt-27-12-Matt-27-14" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">12-14&nbsp;</sup>But while the chief priests and elders were making their accusations, he made no reply at all. So Pilate said to him, &ldquo;Can you not hear the evidence they&rsquo;re bringing against you?&rdquo; And to the governor&rsquo;s amazement, Jesus did not answer a single one of their accusations.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-386" class=3D"text Matt-27-15-Matt-27-21" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">15-21&nbsp;</sup>Now it was the custom at festival-time for the governor to release any prisoner whom the people chose. And it happened that at this time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. So when they assembled to make the usual request, Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Which one do you want me to set free, Barabbas or Jesus called Christ?&rdquo; For he knew very well that the latter had been handed over to him through sheer malice. And indeed while he was actually sitting on the Bench his wife sent a message to him&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have anything to do with that man! I went through agonies dreaming about him last night!&rdquo; But the chief priests and elders persuaded the mob to ask for Barabbas and demand Jesus&rsquo; execution. Then the governor spoke to them, &ldquo;Which of these two are you asking me to release?&rdquo; &ldquo;Barabbas!&rdquo; they cried.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-387" class=3D"text Matt-27-22" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Then what am I to do with Jesus who is called Christ?&rdquo; asked Pilate.</span></div>

At this Pilate said, &ldquo;Why, what is his crime?&rdquo; But their voices rose to a roar, &ldquo;Have him crucified!&rdquo; When Pilate realised that nothing more could be done but that there would soon be a riot, he took a bowl of water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, &ldquo;I take no responsibility for the death of this man. You must see to that yourselves.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-389" class=3D"text Matt-27-25-Matt-27-26" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">25-26&nbsp;</sup>To this the whole crowd replied, &ldquo;Let his blood be on us and on our children!&rdquo; Whereupon Pilate released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus flogged and handed over for crucifixion.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-390" class=3D"text Matt-27-27-Matt-27-31" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">27-31&nbsp;</sup>Then the governor&rsquo;s soldiers took Jesus into the governor&rsquo;s palace and collected the whole guard around him. There they stripped him and put a scarlet cloak upon him. They twisted some thorn-twigs into a crown and put it on his head and put a stick into his right hand. They bowed low before him and jeered at him with the words, &ldquo;Hail, your majesty, king of the Jews!&rdquo; Then they spat on him, took the stick and hit him on the head with it. And when they had finished their fun, they stripped the cloak off again, put his own clothes upon him and led him off for crucifixion.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-391" class=3D"text Matt-27-32" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>On their way out of the city they met a man called Simon, a native of Cyrene in Africa, and they compelled him to carry Jesus&rsquo; cross.</span></div>

<div><span class=3D"text Matt-27-33-Matt-27-35" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">33-35&nbsp;</sup>Then when they came to a place called Golgotha they offered him a drink of wine mixed with some bitter drug (or vinegar mixed with gall or myrrh in other versions of the New Testament), but when he had tasted it he refused to drink. And when they had nailed him to the cross they shared out his clothes by drawing lots.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-393" class=3D"text Matt-27-36-Matt-27-37" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">36-37&nbsp;</sup>Then they sat down to keep guard over him. And over his head they put a placard with the charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>

The passers-by nodded knowingly and called out to him, in mockery, &ldquo;Hi, you who could pull down the Temple and build it up again in three days&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you save yourself? If you are the Son of God, step down from the cross!&rdquo; The chief priests also joined the scribes and elders in jeering at him, saying, &ldquo;He saved others, but he can&rsquo;t save himself! If this is the king of Israel, why doesn&rsquo;t he come down from the cross now, and we&rsquo;ll believe him! He trusted in God ... let God rescue him if He will have anything to do with him! For he said, &lsquo;I am God&rsquo;s son&rsquo;.&rdquo; Even the bandits who were crucified with him hurled abuse at him.</span></div>

But the others said, &ldquo;Let him alone! Let&rsquo;s see if Elijah will come and save him.&rdquo; But Jesus gave one more great cry, and died.</span></div>

<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-400" class=3D"text Matt-27-57-Matt-27-61" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">Jesus is buried and the tomb is guarded</span></h3>
<div><span class=3D"text Matt-27-57-Matt-27-61" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">57-61&nbsp;</sup>That evening, Joseph, a wealthy man from Arimathaea, who was himself a disciple of Jesus, went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave orders for the body to be handed over to him. So Joseph took it, wrapped it in clean linen and placed it in his own new tomb which had been hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a large stone across the doorway of the tomb and went away. But Mary from Magdala and the other Mary remained there, sitting in front of the tomb.</span></div>

We should then be faced with a worse fraud than the first one.&rdquo;</span></div>

<h3><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-403" class=3D"text Matt-28-1-Matt-28-7" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;">The first Lord&rsquo;s day: Jesus rises</span></h3>

At that moment there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from Heaven, went forward and rolled back the stone and took his seat upon it. His appearance was dazzling like lightning and his clothes were white as snow. The guards shook with terror at the sight of him and collapsed like dead men. But the angel spoke to the women, &ldquo;Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here&mdash;he is risen, just as he said he would. Come and look at the place where he was lying. Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead. And, listen, he goes before you into Galilee! You will see him there! Now I have told you my message.&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-404" class=3D"text Matt-28-8" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Then the women went away quickly from the tomb, their hearts filled with awe and great joy, and ran to give the news to his disciples.</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-405" class=3D"text Matt-28-9-Matt-28-10" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup>But quite suddenly, Jesus stood before them in their path, and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you!&rdquo; And they went forward to meet him and, clasping his feet, worshipped him. Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid. Go now and tell my brothers to go into Galilee and they shall see me there&rdquo;</span></div>
<div><span id=3D"en-PHILLIPS-406" class=3D"text Matt-28-11-Matt-28-15" style=3D"font-size: 18pt;"><sup class=3D"versenum">11-15&nbsp;</sup>And while they were on their way, some of the sentries went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. They got together with the elders, and after consultation gave the soldiers a considerable sum of money and told them, &ldquo;Your story must be that his disciples came after dark, and stole him away while you were asleep. If by any chance this reaches the governor&rsquo;s ears, we will put it right with him and see that you do not suffer for it.&rdquo; So they took the money and obeyed their instructions. The story was spread and is current among the Jews to this day.</span></div>

Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you and, remember, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.&rdquo;</span></div>
