<div><span id=3D"en-NLV-1441" class=3D"text Gen-47-20"><sup class=3D"versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh.

<div><span id=3D"en-NLV-1444" class=3D"text Gen-47-23"><sup class=3D"versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Then Joseph said to the people, &ldquo;See, today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh.

<div><span id=3D"en-NLV-1446" class=3D"text Gen-47-25"><sup class=3D"versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>So they said, &ldquo;You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the eyes of my lord.
